## Introduction

CodeWhisperer is a machine learning powered tool that helps developer productivity directly in their IDEs. Based on the previous code and comments in the developers IDE, CodeWhisperer will generate recommendations with what it predicts would be useful code snippets or comments for you to use as you write code. The developer can choose whether they want to accept one of these recommendations, or to continue writing their own code. 

CodeWhisperer also has the ability to scan the developers code for security issues.


## Brief History

CodeWhisperer is a fairly new tool from Amazon, and therefore has a very brief history so far:

- June 2022 - Public preview released. This is open for free for developers worldwide while in its preview period.
- July 2022 - Added support for integration with AWS Lambda
- November 2022 - Added support for two new programming languages; C# and Typescript.

At the time this is written, it has not yet been released any information on the expected date for the full release and what the costs might be.


## Features

CodeWhisperer has several features that enhance the programme and/or help the developer code efficiently, clean and safe. Let's take a look at some of them; 

### Supports popular languages and IDEs
Even though CodeWhisperer is relatively new, it already provides support for several programming languages and IDEs. It can be integrated with multiple IDEs:
- Visual Studio Code
- AWS Cloud 9
- AWS Lambda
- JetBrains (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, Rider)

The languages it supports are
- TypeScript
- C#
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python

### Customized code
Amazons CodeWhisperer is trained on various data sources such as open-source code and internal code on Amazon. With this training the tool will generate suggestions based on analysis of current and previous code and comments in the developers IDE, and the contextual information. Here, contextual information  also includes the current file and the cursor location.

As the developer types, CodeWhisperer will generate code recommendations that it predicts that can be useful for the developer, and that matches their patterns and styles. The developer may always choose to either accept one of the recommendations given, or just continue writing their own code.

### Security
CodeWhisperer has the ability to scan the code for security vulnerabilities, and it scans both the developers code and the code generated by CodeWhisperer in JavaScript, Java and Python projects. Based on its analyses of previous code in the IDE (from both developer and CodeWhisperer), it can identify potential security issues with higher accuracy, and it may also make suggestions on how these can be fixed. 

### Code Reference tracker
Although CodeWhisperer has through its training learned both how to write and generate new code, in rare occasions some code recommendations may still resemble existing code from training.  

If the current code recommendation is similar to a certain training data, CodeWhisperer will notify the developer in real-time. The notification will also contain references to the repository and licensing information for the given code, so that the developer has a more thorough basis to decide if they want to use that code or not, and if so have the information to make code attributions if necessary.


## Strengths

There are several aspects and functions that makes CodeWhisperer an attractive auto-completion tool. How important and useful these strengths are, may vary for the individual developer and their needs and preferences when developing.

### Support for AWS APIs
Although CodeWhisperer is a tool to help developers in general, Amazon has ensured that it will also work very well for developers using AWS systems. It provides code recommendations for APIs across Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and AWS Lambda. By analysing the comments, it uses its cloud services and public libraries to make code recommendations including both smaller snippets and full functions. 

### Learns and adapts to the developer
It has already been covered that CodeWhisperer uses the previous code and comments in the developers' IDE to generate code recommendations. Although this is the absolute basis for it's recommendations, it also takes note of what the developer chooses when presented with these recommendations. CodeWhisperer uses this information to learn more about the developers style and patterns, so it can generate code recommendations that better fit the intent of the developer. 

### Generating larger chunks of code
CodeWhisperer has the ability to not just generate suggestions on single words, but in can generate several lines of code at a time. It can generate full functions, and larger blocks of logical code in real time. 

### Avoiding biased/unfair code
In its training, CodeWhisperer has been trained to not generate biased code. If it were to generate code recommendations that may be considered biased or unfair, they have implemented filters to detect this and remove those code recommendations.


## Weaknesses

Working with CodeWhisperer has a lot of benefits to it. But there are also certain weaknesses and risks involved when using this tool, and other tools like it. 

One of the risks when using CodeWhisperer, and for other tools like this as well, is that developers can become to reliant on them. It can help developers create better code more effortless and effective, but in the long run this can also make it more challenging for developers to write code without this help.

A weakness with CodeWhisperer is that it supports a great deal fewer programming languages and IDEs than some of its competitors, which sets limits to its' field of use. Even though CodeWhisperer is fully workable and open for all developers to use, it is a very new tool an it is per time still in technical preview. Since launch they have added support to a few more languages and IDEs, and it is therefore reasonable to believe that more will be added in the future.


## Comparison

There are several auto-completion tools on the market that all has the intention of making the developers work easier and more effective. These tools have different quality and functionality. Some of the tools are on the simpler end and may help the developer auto-complete single words. Whilst on the other end some tools may help the developer auto-complete larger chunks of relevant code or comments. CodeWhisperer is one of the tools in the latter category. Another tool in this category is GitHubs' Copilot. Because of CodeWhisperer and Copilots’ similarity in functionality, it seems reasonable to make a comparison of these two.
 
### Short introduction to Copilot
Copilot is a AI-assisted auto-completion tool, which uses it analysis of the developers previous code and comments to generate suggestions for new code. It was first introduced as a technical preview in 2021, and in 2022 it was fully released.
 
 
### Similarities
CodeWhisperer and Copilot both uses analyses of the developers’ comments and code in their IDEs, to generate code recommendations they predict fits the developers’ intent in real-time. They can generate multi-lined code snippets and entire functions. The developer has the possibility to choose if they want to use one of the suggestions generated, or to reject it. 
 
 
### Differences
One of the differences between these tools is their support for different programming languages and IDEs. At this point Copilot supports more languages and IDEs then CodeWhisperer does. That being said, it is also important to bear in mind that Copilot has been on the market a year longer, and that this difference can change with time. 
 
Although they function very similar in generating code recommendations, CodeWhisperer will typically provide the developer with better code recommendations then Copilot when writing code for AWS systems, as it has specific training and access on these systems.
 
Copilot and CodeWhisperer also differ when it comes to how they handle code suggestions that are similar to their training. While CodeWhisperer notifies the developer of the issue and provides them with references, Copilot does not has this function yet. They have however made an announcement stating that they are working on a feature for this.


## Preview period

As previously mentioned, Amazon CodeWhisperer is out on preview. During this period, developers worldwide can use it for free. 

Amazon has also ensured that during the preview period, developer-written code will not be used to train CodeWhisperer. 


## Summary

CodeWhisperer is a ML-powered code-completion tool that aims to help developers code faster, more efficiently and by this also save time. It learns from the developers’ code and comments (both previous and new) and the choices they make, to continue to adapt and generate code recommendations that will fit the developers need better and better with time. 
 
This tool also has several features to help the developer code responsibly, both when it comes to detecting security issues and for notifying them of code that may be similar to other data. 
 
CodeWhisperer does not make any decisions for the developer, but it provides enough information for them to make their own decisions.
