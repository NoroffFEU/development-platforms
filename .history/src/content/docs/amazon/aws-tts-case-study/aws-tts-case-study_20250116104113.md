## Introduction

AWS Polly is a cloud-based text-to-speech service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables developers to convert text into lifelike speech, supporting a wide range of languages and voices. Polly is designed to make applications more engaging by adding natural-sounding speech capabilities, useful for applications such as eLearning, accessibility, voice assistants, and more.

This case study explores Polly's capabilities, its position in the market, and how developers can get started with it.

## Brief History

AWS Polly was introduced in **2016** as part of AWS's broader suite of AI-driven services. The service was created to address the growing need for high-quality, automated text-to-speech solutions across industries. Over time, Polly has evolved to include neural text-to-speech (NTTS) technology, offering more realistic and natural voices compared to traditional speech synthesis.
