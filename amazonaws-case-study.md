## Main Features

Amazon Web Services provides an array of solutions in various industries. Its main purpose is cloud computing, meaning data can be stored and retrieved remotely. This is useful because you don't have to rely on
having your own storage or server to manage data. Instead of relying on your own hardware, you "pay-as-you-go" by paying for the amount of traffic your company or service requires. This is beneficial as server traffic is an ever-changing variable, so the cost of the cloud storage is always coherrent with the need.

Features
- Web Hosting
- DevOps
- E-commerce
- And many more, these are just a few of the features relevant for this case study. A funny way to put is not what AWS offers, but what does it not offer?
