## Introduction
This case study examines Netlify and Vercel, two leading web hosting and deployment platforms designed for modern web development, especially for Jamstack-based projects. 
Both platforms are popular among developers for their ease of use, automated deployments, and supportt for static and dynamic web applications.
This analysis will explore their history, feature, market positioning, and how they compare to each other.

## Expressions Explained
Jamstack - Jamstack is a modern web development architecture that stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It promotes pre-rendered static sites and serverless functions to improve speed, security, and scalability.
Static Site Generation <SSG> - SSG is a method where web pages are pre-built at deployment time rather than being generated dynamically for each request. This makes websites faster and more secure. Frameworks like Gatsby, Jekyll, and Hugo commonly use SSG.
Server-Side Rendering <SSR> - SSR is a technique where web pages are generated on the server before being sent to the user's browser. This allows for dynamic content and better SEO. Vercel is optimized for SSR, especially with Next.js.
Incremental Static Regeneration <ISR> - ISR is a hybrid approach that allows statically generated pages to be updated at runtime without rebuilding the entire site. This is useful for sites that need fresh content but still want fast performance. Vercel supports ISR natively for Next.js projects.
Edge Functions / Edge Computing - Edge computing processes data closer to the user by running small serverless functions on a global network of edge locations rather than a central server. This results in faster load times and lower latency for users worldwide.
Cold Start - A cold start happens when a serverless function takes extra time to execute because it hasn’t been used recently. This can cause delays for users. Vercel’s Edge Functions tend to have faster cold start times than Netlify’s AWS Lambda-based functions.
Global Content Delivery Network <CDN> - A CDN is a network of distributed servers that cache website content closer to the user’s location. Both Netlify and Vercel use CDNs to ensure fast loading speeds globally.
Serverless Functions - Serverless functions allow developers to run backend code without managing servers. They are event-driven and only execute when needed, which reduces costs. Netlify uses AWS Lambda, while Vercel offers its own Edge & Serverless Functions.
Git-based Deployments - Both Netlify and Vercel allow developers to automatically deploy their websites from Git repositories. Whenever code is updated, the platform rebuilds and redeploys the site automatically.
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment <CI/CD> - CI/CD is a development practice where code is automatically tested and deployed every time a developer makes a change. Netlify and Vercel both offer automated CI/CD pipelines to streamline the development process.
Custom Domains & SSL - Both platforms allow users to connect their own domain name and include free SSL certificates <which encrypt data between the website and the user>.
