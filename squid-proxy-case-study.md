## Introduction

Caching tools are unlike databases designed to keep information for a short period of time.
‚ÄúCaching is a process that stores multiple copies of data or files in a temporary storage location- or cache- so they can be accessed faster.‚Äù

This process helps with bandwidth and speed, because the server saves data for later, and can easily deliver it to the next visiter.
The data stored in a cache can be HTML files, images, documents, DNS records and API calls, and there are several different types of caching tools, in-memory caching, disk caching, distributed caching and reverse proxy caching.  
A proxy web server is a reverse proxy caching, a caching HTTP reverse proxy, and this is the type of caching tool that Squid web proxies are.
In other words, Squid Proxy Server is a provider of shared and private HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure) proxies, but it also supports other protocols like FTP(File Transfer Protocol),Internet Gopher, Secure Sockets Layer(SSL), Transport Layer (TLS)  
The meaning of proxy is a middleman, and a proxy web server serves as a middleman between your computer and the internet pages you want to visit. It provides you with IP addresses, and sends them to the website you visit instead of your own IP address, keeping your identity and location, and all of your metadata, safe and secret.
This can improve security for you and your data, it can allow you to browse privately, can help if you want to watch content restricted for your location, and can improve on connection speeds and bandwidth.

## Brief History

Caching has been used since the start of the internet, but at the beginning it was done more on the client side than the server side, which has changed, due to issues with data duplication and source of truth.
Squid was the earliest reverse proxy project that still exist, and is still very popular today.
1996- Squid version 1.0.0 was released. It was first called the Harvest object cache and developed as part of the Harvest project at the University of Colorado Boulder, but the project was completed at the University of San Diego.
Before it was released it was renamed Squid to avoid name confusion with the Commercial fork named Cached 2.0 which later became NetCache.
2006- SquidNT, a port of the Squid proxy server was merged into the main Squid project.
2023- Squid is now developed almost exclusively through volunteer efforts.

## Main Features

Caching- frequently accessed content and websites get stored in cache memory, to reduce loading time and bandwidth for the next visit(er).
Forwarding- client requests can be forwarded to web clients, retrieved and delivered to client. This keeps clients private, and can give the possibility of other services like access control, authentication, content filtering and traffic optimization.
Access control- offers access control, allowing restrictions for IP addresses and content, and gives CEO the tools to control their employees online activity during work hours.
Authentication- supports different kinds of authorization. This allows administrators to be able to monitor user behavior and give user-based access control.
Content filtering- can be set up to filter web content.
Traffic optimization- can help optimize network traffic, reduce latency and improve overall network performance.

For personal use this means that it can be used for things like private browsing the web, to watch TV shows or content online that is blocked in your area and to get better bandwidth for gaming.

For businesses it can have many purposes like:

-Being able to give your costumers better bandwith and server speed.
-For better security for businesses databases.
-To be able to have several accounts for social media channels like Facebook or Twitter without being blocked.
-To improve SEO for the business website.
-Better control over employees online activities at work, stopping them from visiting certain websites or
monitoring the time spent online.

## Private and shared hosting

The difference between private and shared hosting is price, security and speed.

The most expensive hosting options are the private hosting plans, but they come with the benefits of more security and not having to worry about not getting enough bandwidth for your projects or getting blocked for actions made by others.

## Who uses Squid

It is widely used, and some of the users include: enterprise networks, educational institutions and other environments where efficient caching, content control, data security and network optimization is important.

## Strengths

Squid has few options and is easy to understand, at the same time as it is extremely flexible and customizable.
You can choose between private data center proxies, which are yours alone, or shared proxies, that is shared with others.
It is easy to set up (set up guide) and is said to have an excellent support if you should have some issues on the way.
Squid offers different plans depending on your needs, and a 7 days money back guarantee if you are not happy, and it is also freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

## Weaknesses

Squid does not offer ISP, residential or mobile proxies, or rotating proxies. Neither do they have dedicated proxies for Craigslist, Nike or Ticketmaster.
It has less integrations compered to softwares like Varnish with only two compared to 12, and also less training possibilities with only online training.
Ths network is small too, with proxies in only ten countries compared to competitor Oxylabs 88.

## Set up

Many operating systems comes with Squid already installed on them, but if your¬¥s don¬¥t you can download it from [the official website](http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/).
The setup is fairly easy and your proxies will be up and running in just 5-10 minutes, which is much faster than other similar software on the market.

## Reviews:

‚ÄúGreat value data center proxies for newbies on a budget. Cheap and easy-to-use private and shared proxies with excellent support on hand. Not many features, but otherwise a must-see for proxy beginners and old hands on a budget.‚Äù

‚ÄúReduce bandwidth use and deliver your most frequently requested web pages more quickly with Squid Proxy Server‚Äù

## Conclusion

Squid proxy web server is an affordable and scalable option if you are on the market for a reverse proxy server.
If Squid is the right web proxy server for you, depends on your needs, there are many options out there.
