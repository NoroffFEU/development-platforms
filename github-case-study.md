## Features

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration that allows developers to store and share their code. Here are some of the key features of GitHub:

- **Version control:** GitHub allows developers to easily track changes to their code over time.
  This is achieved through the use of Git, a distributed version control system.

- **Collaboration:** GitHub allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously,
  and provides tools for managing pull requests, code reviews, and other collaboration workflows.

- **Branches:** A user can start a new branch either from the main branch or a different branch.
  This allows the user to write new code for the project without adding it to the project itself.
  When new code is written on a new branch it can be merged into the main project.
  Usually, users make a pull request before merging. This system enables users to develop code on different versions of a project at the same time.

- **Pull requests:** When a user has made changes to a project's code on a separate branch, he can make a pull request.
  This is an important step in quality control where other developers can inspect the changes in the code.
  They do this to make sure that the code is bug-free and has no issues.
  When it is determined that the code is safe it can be merged from this branch to its parent branch or the main branch.

- **Issue tracking:** GitHub includes a powerful issue-tracking system that allows users to report bugs,
  suggest new features, and track progress on specific tasks.

- **Merging:** Adding new code to a project from a separate branch. usually, this is done after a pull request.

- **GitHub Actions:** This is a feature where you can add automated tasks to a project.
  The automated tasks can either be run manually or be set to run at specific points of development such as when a pull request is made.
  GitHub actions are very flexible and allow for lots of different programming languages and tools to be used with it.
  examples of GitHub actions usage: deploy to static pages, end-to-end testing and unit testing.

- **Marketplace:** GitHub Marketplace is a platform that offers a variety of apps and tools that can be integrated with GitHub to enhance developer workflows, automate tasks, and improve productivity.
