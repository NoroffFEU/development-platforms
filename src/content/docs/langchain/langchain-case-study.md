## Example code 
1. Basic Prompt and LLM Chain
This example demonstrates a foundational use case of LangChain.js: creating a chain that processes user input through a prompt, an LLM, and an output parser.The key components used are:

- ChatPromptTemplate: Defines a reusable prompt template with placeholders for dynamic values (e.g., {foo} in the joke request).
- ChatOpenAI: Represents a chat-based language model, such as GPT.
- StringOutputParser: Parses and returns the LLM's response as plain text.
- Pipe Operator: Connects the components in sequence for streamlined data flow.
In this code, the chain generates a joke about "bears" by dynamically injecting the value into the template, passing it to the LLM, and parsing the result. This illustrates how to build basic, reusable components for LLM interactions.

```javascript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "langchain/prompts";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { StringOutputParser } from "langchain/schema/output_parser";

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate("tell me a joke about {foo}");
const model = new ChatOpenAI();
const outputParser = new StringOutputParser();

const chain = prompt.pipe(model).pipe(outputParser);

const result = await chain.invoke({ foo: "bears" });
console.log(result);
```

2. Using a Custom Tool
This example introduces the concept of custom tools, which extend LangChain’s functionality beyond basic prompt-response patterns.

- The CircumferenceTool class inherits from LangChain's Tool base class, enabling developers to create specialized tools with custom logic (in this case, calculating the circumference of a circle given its radius).
- The _call method defines the tool's core behavior, processing input and returning results.
- This approach showcases how developers can create domain-specific tools to enhance the capabilities of LangChain agents, such as adding mathematical or data-processing functionalities.

```javascript
import { Tool } from "langchain/tools";

class CircumferenceTool extends Tool {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.name = "Circumference calculator";
        this.description = "Use this tool when you need to calculate a circumference using the radius of a circle";
    }

    async _call(input) {
        const { radius } = input;
        return parseFloat(radius) * 2.0 * Math.PI;
    }
}
```
3. Creating an Agent with Tool Calling
This example shows how to build an agent—a flexible AI system that interacts with tools to perform tasks. Key components include:

- ChatOpenAI: The language model powering the agent.
- Calculator Tool: A pre-built tool for performing arithmetic operations.
initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions: A function that sets up the agent with tools, enabling it to call them dynamically.
- In this case, the agent is configured to use OpenAI's function-calling feature (via agentType: "openai-functions") and demonstrates how to handle a specific user query (adding 2323 and 3334). This highlights LangChain.js's ability to integrate tools into LLM-powered workflows.

```javascript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions } from "langchain/agents";
import { Calculator } from "langchain/tools/calculator";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({
    modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    temperature: 0,
});
const tools = [new Calculator()];
const executor = await initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions(tools, model, {
    agentType: "openai-functions",
    verbose: true,
});
const result = await executor.call({
  input: "what is 2323 plus 3334?",
});
console.log(result.output)
```

4. LangServe Client
This example demonstrates how to interact with LangChain applications deployed as REST APIs using the LangServe client.

- RemoteRunnable: Connects to a remote LangChain server to invoke a deployed chain.
In this code, the chain processes an input topic ("cats") by calling a LangServe endpoint, showcasing how to integrate LangChain.js into distributed systems and microservice architectures.

```javascript
import { RemoteRunnable } from "langchain/runnables/remote";

const chain = new RemoteRunnable({ url: `http://localhost:8000/chain/invoke/` });
const result = await chain.invoke({ topic: "cats" });
```

5. Using Memory in a Chain
This example illustrates the use of memory in LangChain.js to maintain context across multiple user interactions. Key components:

- ConversationSummaryMemory: A memory object that summarizes conversation history, enabling the chatbot to "remember" past interactions.
- ChatPromptTemplate with MessagesPlaceholder: A structured prompt that includes both static instructions (e.g., "You are a helpful chatbot") and dynamic placeholders (e.g., "history" for memory).
- ConversationChain: Combines the memory, prompt, and language model into a cohesive unit for conversational applications.
This example highlights LangChain.js's capability to build stateful conversational agents that deliver coherent, context-aware responses over extended dialogues.

```javascript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { ConversationChain } from "langchain/chains";
import {
  ChatPromptTemplate,
  MessagesPlaceholder,
} from "langchain/prompts";
import { ConversationSummaryMemory } from "langchain/memory";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({});

const memory = new ConversationSummaryMemory({
  llm: model,
  returnMessages: true
});

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
    [ "system", "You are a helpful chatbot"],
    new MessagesPlaceholder("history"),
    ["human", "{input}"]
]);

const chain = new ConversationChain({
  memory: memory,
  prompt: prompt,
  llm: model,
});

const response = await chain.call({ input: "Hi I'm Bob!" });
console.log(response);
const secondResponse = await chain.call({ input: "What was my name?" });
console.log(secondResponse);

```
