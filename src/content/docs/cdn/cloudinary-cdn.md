## Introduction

In an ever-growing online world, performance and availability become core for any website looking to serve multimedia assets. CDNs looks to provide this by creating a network of servers and serving the content to the end-user from the geographically closest server to them, known as the “edge server”.

This works perfectly for improving load times for websites but comes with the drawback of assets getting stale if the original is updated. CDN is ideal for websites where its contents get updated rarely.
