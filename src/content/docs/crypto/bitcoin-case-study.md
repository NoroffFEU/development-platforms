# Case Study: Bitcoin

## Introduction

Bitcoin - the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, developed by Satoshi Nakamoto who emerged from the shadows of the 2008 financial crisis - proposed a decentralized form of money that could operate independently of traditional banking systems. It is a peer-to-peer digital currency that allows for direct transactions without the need for intermediaries, using blockchain technology to maintain a public ledger of all transactions.

## History

Satoshi Nakamoto - although whether or not that is the actual name of the creator remains unknown, with the domain name Bitcoin.org registered in August 2008, and the network coming into existence in January 2009 with the release of the first Bitcoin software - Nakamoto mined the first block of Bitcoins, known as the genesis block, and embedded a reference to a newspaper article to timestamp the creation date.

### 2008

* Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto - Although whether or not that is the actual name of the creator remains unknown.

* With the domain name Bitcoin.org registered in August 2008 and later that year, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto himself titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" (see references) the cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin was emerging from the shadows.

### 2009

* On the 3rd of January, 2009 - the Bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi mining the first block of Bitcoins, known as the genesis block, and embedded the reference to a newspaper article to timestamp the creation date.

### 2010

* in 2010 the first real purchase was made using Bitcoin, the purchase was of two pizzas from Papa John's exchanging 10,000 mined Bitcoins, delivered from a local pizza restaurant in Florida. This later became the Bitcoin Pizza Day for crypto-fans.

* In August 2010 a significant flaw was spotted in Bitcoin's protocol. This flaw would be exploited when someone on the 15th of August would conduct a transaction that created over 92 billion Bitcoins after spending just half a Bitcoin.
The flaw in question was related to how the system checked to ensure that the output of a transaction did not exceed its input, as it failed to prevent an overflow issue with outputs that added up to more than the maximum value a 64-bit number can hold. In essence, this meant that, theoretically, someone could create a transaction that generated an enormous amount of Bitcoin out of thin air. This was promptly corrected, and the vulnerability was solved.

### 2011

* Based on Bitcoin's open-source code, other cryptocurrencies started emerging.

* platforms such as WikiLeaks started accepting Bitcoins as donations.

### 2012

* In October, BitPay reported over 1000 merchants accepting Bitcoin under its payment processing service.

* The first Bitcoin halving took place, decreasing Bitcoins mined from 50 to 25.

 **Quick brief about Bitcoin Halving:** Every 4 years or so, an event occurs where the reward for mining new Bitcoins is cut in half, This event plays a crucial role in controlling the supply of Bitcoin and has a significant impact on its price and overall ecosystem. Essentially it's like gold mining, the more gold that is mined - the less gold is available to mine. And when there is less gold to be found, it becomes harder to find - increasing its value. 



### 2013

* Crypto market Coinbase sold over $1 million worth of Bitcoins.

* Bitcoin blockchain temporarily forked; normal operation resumed after a downgrade.

* A landmark decision came in August when a U.S. federal judge in Texas ruled that Bitcoin is a form of money, acknowledging its value and potential use in the financial system. 

* In October - Vancouver, Canada opened the world's first Bitcoin ATM bridging cryptocurrency and the physical world.

### 2014

* After a spark of mainstream interest - Zynga tested Bitcoin for in-game purchases and Las Vegas casinos started accepting Bitcoin.

* Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange, abruptly halted withdrawals following a massive cyber heist leading to a bankruptcy filing that shook the crypto world.

* Microsoft began accepting Bitcoin for Xbox games and Windows software.

### 2015

* Bitcoin's journey into the mainstream gained further momentum. Coinbase, a leading figure in the cryptocurrency exchange space, raised an impressive $75 million. This further solidified investor's confidence in Bitcoin's value and technology.

* Number of merchants accepting Bitcoin exceeded 100,000.

* A proposal was submitted to add a Bitcoin symbol to Unicode.

### 2016

* Japan took a groundbreaking step by officially recognizing Bitcoin as a legal payment method, providing a massive boost to the currency's legitimacy.

* By July, the public view on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies started to shift, a study emerged showing that Bitcoin was no longer the currency of the underground and that it was a legitimate form of transaction.

* The second Bitcoin halving takes place, reducing Bitcoins mined from 25 to 12.5.


### 2017
* Bitcoin's value exceeds $10,000.

* The Bitcoin sign is officially added to the Unicode Standard.

* Due to a long-standing disagreement within the community over how to best scale the network, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created. This split in Bitcoin currencies represented differing visions for the future of Bitcoin.

### 2018

* After steadily increasing in value, Bitcoin has its biggest price drop ever recorded. Going from $20,000 at the end of 2017 to just above $3,000 - a decline of over 80% from its peak.

* Many payment processors and banks stopped supporting or outright banned the use of Bitcoin as a result of the price drop.

### 2019

* Bitcoin's value fluctuated, starting the year below $4,000 and peaking at over $12,000 in July before settling down around $7,300.

* Bitcoin interest saw a resurgence with the rise of IEOs (Initial Exchange Offerings), notably the BitTorrent offering that concluded in seconds, signaling a new trend in crypto fundraising. Alternative cryptocurrencies started growing significantly.

### 2020

* Bitcoin once again exceeds $10,000.

* The third Bitcoin halving reduces Bitcoins mined from 12.5 to 6.25.

* Institutional adoption increased, with companies like MicroStrategy investing heavily.

* Bitcoin surpassed its all-time high price of $20,089 at the end of the year in December, reaching over $23,000.

### 2021

* Following the record in December 2020, Bitcoin continues to rapidly grow in price - starting at $35,000 in January and ending at $56,288, A new all-time high. The price drops back and stabilizes yet again at around $35,000 before rising to the highest peak of a staggering $66,000 in November 2021.

* The price hike of Bitcoin in 2021 was connected to the launch of a Bitcoin ETF in the US, as well as events involving Tesla and Coinbase, respectively.


### 2022

* Economic factors and market crashes led to significant drops in Bitcoin's price.

* Bitcoin's value drops to $20,000 rapidly, all the way to $16,000 before the end of the year.

### 2023

* after crashing in 2022, Bitcoin has seen a slow rise and has stabilized at a value of around $30,000.

## Applications

### Digital Currency: 
Bitcoin enables direct financial transactions without the need for a central authority, making it popular for online purchases and cross-border transactions.

### Store of Value: 
Often referred to as "digital gold," Bitcoin is used by some as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.

### Remittances: 
Bitcoin provides a low-cost alternative for sending payments, especially in regions with limited access to banking services.


## Strengths

### Decentralization: 
Bitcoin's decentralized nature protects it from censorship and allows for global participation without central control.

### Security: 
Bitcoin's blockchain is secure through a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, making it computationally impractical to alter past transactions.

### Limited Supply: 
The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, making it a deflationary asset by design.

## Weaknesses

### Volatility: 
The price of Bitcoin is highly volatile, making it a risky investment and a challenging medium of exchange.

### Scalability: 
Bitcoin's network has limitations on transaction throughput, leading to potential delays and higher transaction fees during peak usage.

### Environmental Impact: 
The proof-of-work system consumes a significant amount of energy, leading to concerns about its environmental footprint.


## Comparison to Other Forms of Money

Compared to traditional fiat currencies, Bitcoin offers distinct advantages in terms of its decentralized and digital nature. However, it lacks the stability and widespread acceptance of government-backed currencies. Against other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin maintains the advantage of being the first and most recognized, which has translated into a larger user base and greater security due to its extensive network and history.

## Conclusion

Bitcoin stands atop the cryptocurrency world, being the most widely used and adopted digital currency.
But despite its strengths and technological advancement in the financial sector which has changed the way people look at the future of digital currencies, it's still a volatile asset that involves investment risks and challenges.
