# Introduction:

GitHub creates an environment that allows you to store your code on a remote server online, and gives you the ability to share your code with other people, and makes it easy for more than one person to modify, add or delete code to the same file and project, while keeping the one source of truth for that file.
It's like using Google docs for programmers, - a place online where you can write code with other people and not have to email different versions back and forth.

## Little bit of history (to present time 2025):

Founded in April 2008 by Tom Preston-werner, Chris Wanstrath, P.J Hyett, and Scott Chacon, as a platform for veron control and collaboration using Git.
It became so large and popular, that it was acquired by Microsoft in 2018.

- 2007: Development of GitHub begains.
- 2007: Offically launched 10th April.

** Groth and Features **

- 2009 to 2013, GitHub added several features like including GitHub Enterprise and GitHub Pages, and gained huge popularity, by big tech companies like Googe, and FaceBook.

- 2012: Andreessen Horowitz invested 100 million USD in GitHub. (Valuation of 750 million USD).

- 2015: Allowing for unlimited private repositories.
  (Changing in pricing model to a user-based system).

- 2018: Aquried by Microsoft.

- 2023 (Recent): Solidifying its position as the largest source code host, with over 150 million users and more than 500 million repositories.

** Its impact on Software Development **

It became so big, that it transformed how developers collaborate on code, making it easier to share, review, and manage projects. User-friendly interface and robust features made a big impact on its succsess.

** Biggest EVER DDoS Attack hits GitHubs website (Distributed Denail of Service) **

Wednesday, February 28, 2018, GitHub where hit with the largest distributed denail of service (DDoS) attack that peaked at a record high of 1.35Tbps.
To this date, of 2018, it was the largest attack seen by Akamai. It was more then twice the size of the attacks publicly disclosed. (Septemper 2016). Akamai, is a cloud computing company that helped GitHub to survive the attack.

** Microsoft purchase GitHub for 7.5 billion dollars in 2018 **

Microsoft bought GitHub because they wanted to strengthen their position in open source and cloud computing, attracting more developers to their Azure (Cloud computing platform), and integrating GitHub with their developer platform like Visual Studio Code.
In other words, the acquisition gave Microsoft a key role in their open source and AI investment. Still, GitHub is a leading role platform, despite Microsofts leading impact.

### GitHubs key features:

** Branches **

One of the greatest things is branches. Branches allows you to develop feautures, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository, is safe to do changes, add new feautures, and play around, without worrying about destroying the whole project.
When creating an branch, and stores content on GitHub, GitHub creates the repository with a single branch called main, or default branch. Lets say your working on an feauture like "adding a new search field", you create an new branch, doing the changes and making it, then adding it to the main branch, if there is no problem, buggs or conflicts. Its then safe to do a "pull request", and the feauture will be "merge" into main or default branch.

** Pull Request **

Pull Request is a request to the maintainer of a repository to pull in somde code. Let say you have added a feature, it working fine, and you want to make that change to main branch, you create and submit a pull request. This gives the repository maintainers an opportunity to review the changes and either accept them, reject, og ask for more changes to be made, before merging them into main branch.

** Merging **

This is the last step before actually adding the code (from another branch) to main, when the pull request is done and everything is fine, and there is no issuess, the code then gets added to the main branch.

** Issuess **

With issurss, we mean a tool for tracking ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs in a repository.
We use issuess to plan, discuss, and manage work. Its also possible to categorize issues with labels, assign them to collaborators, and then add them to projects for better organization.

** GitHub Actions **

Think about GitHub Actions like a tool that helps you automate tasks in our software projects. It will automatically build, test, and deploy your code whenever something happens our repository, like a new commit or pull request. This is a way to set up "if this happens, then do that" type of thing, it rules your code.

** GitHub Pages **

This is also a really good feature GitHub have, and it is GitHub Pages. It's a free service that lets you create and host a website directly from a GitHub Repository. It takes your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and processes them, and publishes them as a static website. We can use it for personal sites, project documentations, or organization pages.

** Integration **

Many people use code editors like Visual Studio Code. You can use GitHubs repositories and link them up with VScode, without leaving it. It is possible to intergrate our personal or organization account on GitHub.com with third-party project management tools.
It is also possible to use GitHub for teams app for our repositories or organizations and get real time updates about activity for features on GitHub.

** GitHub Enterprise **

GitHub also have a version designed for businesses and organizations. It have more advanced tools and features to help teams collaborate on code securely and efficiently.
GitHub Enterprise Cloud: This allows companies to manage multiple organizations, enforce policies, and ensure security while using its cloud infrastructure.
GitHub Enterprise Server: Provides the same features, but runs on the company's own private cloud or server, it's self-hosted by teh company.

#### Strenghts

By now, you probably have a good understanding about how GitHub works, and with that, it have verry good and strong perks. But here is a little list of it:

** Collaboration **

GitHub makes it possible to work with multiple people on the same project without overwriting each other's work. It's easy to use features like branches and pull requests to propose, reviews, and merge changes.

** Version Control **

We can see who made what changes and revert to earlier versions if needed. GitHub tracks every change made to our files.

** Accessibility **

It's so easy, you can use tools like GitHub Desktop, command-line Git, or IDEs, depending on what you preferred to use, and what makes it easyer for you. Or you can work directly in your browser. And the best thing is, that everyone can user whatever tool they want, dosn't have to be the same tool.

** Integration **

To make workflows even smoother, you can use GitHub Actions for automation. GitHub works with many tools and services.

** Community **

Its not only a hub for open-source projects, but you can also contribute to learn from millions of repository.

** Security **

GitHub have greate security features, for all GitHub plans, it offer various security features to help keep our code and secrets secure. GitHub also have an Advanced Security as well, that offers more if needed.

** Desktop app **

This one is just best when it comes to workflow.

** Mobile app **

GitHub offers an IOS and Android app. You can do things like manage notifications, review issuess and pull requests, edit files, search repositories, and collaborate on GitHub from anywhere on your phone.

** GitHub Pages **

That you can host your own website on GitHub, directly from your repository.

##### Weaknesses:

** Overwelming **

GitHub can be overwelming for new users because of its complexity. The system works greate, but if you don't know what your looking at, it can be difficult and feels like it's a loot of things that happens at once. We all will relate to this, trust me.

** Storage capasity **

There are limited storage capacity for free accounts, like for how much space you can have, and if you want more storage, you'll have to pay extra.

** Limitations **

Since GitHub is free to use and almost have all the features available, it comes at a cost. You have limitations like max 1,000 open PRs per branch, 1 merge / minute, API Rate Limits to name some.

###### Comparison:

I would actually say nothing compaires to GitHub. It's ecosystem, feautures and overall, it's just superb. If the UI was a bit easier for newer ones, it would literly be as perfect as it's get, we have to remember it's also free to use, so it have limitations.

We have some other platforms similar to GitHub:

** GitLab **

All in one platform for version control, CI/CD like, it is similar to GitHub with Git-based repositories.
It's differense is that GitLab have more built-in DevOps tools like integrated CI/CD.

** Bitbucket **

Bitbucket have much the same features like Git and Mercurial repositories, Pull Requests, and teamwork.
The difference is that its strong integration with Atlassian tools like Jiar and Trello, (Owned by Atlassian).

## Summary:

Easy to use, lightweight platform for open-source projects to work on. It's simplicity (but can be owervelming for new users) is a grate start for storing your repositories and hosting your own website. For it to be free, it have good features and i don't really think it lacks features, despite it's free to use. Ofcourse it have limits, but it's more like for big businesses / enterprises.
Personally, i really like GitHub, what it offers, and what you can do, free of use. i would really recommend using GitHub to others who code and developing.
