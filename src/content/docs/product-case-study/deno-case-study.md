# Deno Case Study

## Introduction

Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, created by Ryan Dahl — the original creator of Node.js. It was designed to fix the shortcomings of Node.js with better security, a simplified module system, and built-in TypeScript support.

## History

Deno was first introduced in 2018 during a talk titled “10 Things I Regret About Node.js.” Ryan Dahl created Deno as a fresh take on a server-side JavaScript runtime, addressing problems like package management and lack of built-in security. Deno reached its stable 1.0 release in May 2020.

## Applications and Use Cases

- Running JavaScript/TypeScript outside the browser
- Web servers and API backends
- Command-line tools
- Serverless functions
- Scripts for automation

## Strengths

- **Security by default**: No file, network, or environment access unless explicitly enabled
- **Built-in TypeScript support**: No separate compiler needed
- **Simplified module imports**: Uses URLs instead of `node_modules`
- **Built-in tooling**: Includes formatter, linter, test runner, and bundler

## Weaknesses

- **Smaller ecosystem**: Less mature than Node.js
- **Fewer libraries**: Not all Node.js packages are compatible
- **Learning curve**: New conventions and APIs

## Comparison with Node.js

| Feature            | Deno                             | Node.js                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Language Support   | JavaScript & TypeScript          | JavaScript (TypeScript optional) |
| Security           | Secure by default                | No security by default          |
| Package Management | No `node_modules`, uses URLs     | Uses npm and `node_modules`     |
| Tools              | Built-in (test, lint, fmt)       | Requires installing tools       |
| Ecosystem          | Smaller but growing              | Very large and mature           |

## Conclusion

Deno is a powerful and secure alternative to Node.js, especially for developers who want built-in TypeScript and modern tooling. While its ecosystem is still growing, it offers a cleaner and more secure approach to building JavaScript applications for the backend or CLI.
