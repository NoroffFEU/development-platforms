Tags: Case Study, Supabase, BaaS, Database

## Introduction

Supabase is an **open source backend as a service (BaaS)** that gives developers everything they need to build full-stack web apps **without setting up their own backend**. Unlike Firebase, Supabase is **completely open source**, allowing for self-hosting, more transparency, and no vendor lock-in.

It integrates a **PostgreSQL database** with a clean UI, built in **authentication**, **file storage**, **edge functions**, and **real time updates** making it a full-featured backend for front end developers and rapid prototyping.

## Expanded Context and Integration

To make this case study more comprehensive, we also explore **how Supabase integrates with front end processes, organizational workflows, and interdisciplinary collaboration**.

### Front End Integration

Supabase seamlessly connects with front end frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) via REST and GraphQL APIs, enabling real time updates, authentication, and data manipulation directly from the client. This reduces backend complexity and accelerates project development.

### Organizational Requirements

Teams can use Supabase to implement standardized workflows, role based access control, and data governance policies. It fits well in agile environments, supporting collaboration between developers, designers, and product managers.

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration

Supabase can work alongside other APIs, cloud services, and DevOps pipelines, allowing different disciplines (frontend, backend, operations) to contribute efficiently. For example, edge functions can handle backend logic while front end developers focus on user experience.

### Comparative Analysis

Beyond Firebase and AWS Amplify, other platforms like Hasura and Appwrite can be compared for features, scalability, and openness, providing a broader perspective on development platform options.

### Practical Examples and Visuals

Adding architectural diagrams or workflow visuals helps illustrate integrated full stack solutions, showing how Supabase supports real world project deployment and team collaboration.

## A Bit of History

- Founded in **2020** by **Paul Copplestone** and **Ant Wilson**, originally as a hackathon project.
- Gained popularity quickly due to demand for a simpler and open alternative to Firebase.
- Supported by **Y Combinator**, which accelerated feature growth and adoption.
- Used globally in **education**, **indie development**, and **startups**, especially for real time applications and quick prototypes.

---

## Where It’s Useful

Supabase is highly versatile and ideal for:

- **Web apps built in React, Vue, Svelte, etc.** seamless integration via REST or GraphQL APIs.
- **Mobile apps using React Native, Ionic, Flutter** ready to use SDKs simplify connecting to the backend.
- **Dashboards and internal tools** – built in auth, storage, and SQL queries help create management interfaces quickly.
- **Real-time apps** (chat, multiplayer games) – native real time subscriptions keep UI synchronized with database changes.
- **SaaS platforms** needing auth and scalable data handles user accounts, access control, and file management.
- **Prototypes, hackathons, and student projects** low setup time lets you focus on front end and business logic.

It is perfect for **rapid development** without deep backend expertise.

## Pricing Comparison

| Service     | Free Tier Limitations                     | Paid Plans                           | Notes                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supabase    | 500MB DB, 1GB Storage, 50k requests/mo    | \$25/mo for Pro                      | Transparent pricing, usage based scaling                  |
| Firebase    | 1GB DB, 5GB Storage, 50k reads/writes/day | Pay as you go                        | Can get expensive with heavy usage, proprietary ecosystem |
| AWS Amplify | 5GB Storage, 1M requests/mo               | \$10 - \$100+ depending on resources | Requires AWS services for backend, higher complexity      |

This comparison shows that Supabase offers a **very accessible free tier** and predictable pricing without vendor lock in, making it ideal for students and small projects.

## Real-World Example: SupaTasks

Building a simple to-do app with Supabase:

1. **Create Supabase project**
2. **Create tasks table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  is_complete boolean DEFAULT false,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

3. **Set up authentication** with Supabase Auth
4. **Add row level security**:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own tasks"
  ON tasks FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

5. **Front end (React)**:

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('tasks').select('*');
```

6. **Real time listener**:

```javascript
supabase.channel('tasks')
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'tasks' }, (payload) => {
    console.log('Change received!', payload);
  })
  .subscribe();
```
