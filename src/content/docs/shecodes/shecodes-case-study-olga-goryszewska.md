## Introduction to SheCodes

A Platform for Empowering Women in Technology

In the rapidly advancing field of technology, the presence of gender disparity remains a significant challenge. SheCodes, founded in October 2017 by Matt Delac, a seasoned full-stack engineer, is a pioneering platform committed to bridging this gap. It was initially conceived as a small workshop aimed at teaching basic coding to a handful of women. Due to high demand and positive participant feedback, it quickly expanded into a substantial, influential program.

SheCodes is distinguished by its dynamic approach to learning and its dedication to fostering inclusivity and diversity within the tech community. This case study explores the inception, growth, and impact of SheCodes, highlighting its role in reducing the gender gap in technology and shaping the careers of thousands of women worldwide.

**2020**: SheCodes had hosted numerous beginner and advanced coding workshops by early 2020, including specialized courses like SheCodes Plus and SheCodes React. The first workshops, branded as SheCodes 1.0, gained significant popularity, leading to rapid expansion.
