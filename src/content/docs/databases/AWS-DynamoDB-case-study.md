## Introduction

AWS DynamoDB is a managed Non-Relational Database (`NoSQL`) service provided by Amazon Web Services (`AWS`). It was designed to offer a highly scalable, fully managed, and low-latency database solution for developers and businesses needing to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.

## Brief History

In the mid-2000s, Amazon.com's exponential e-commerce growth posed a challenge, which was managing and scaling their database infrastructure. Traditional relational databases struggled with the vast data and traffic generated. Amazon sought a solution delivering high `performance`, `scalability`, and `reliability`.

In 2004, Amazon engineers acknowledged the need for a novel database to meet scalability demands. They came up with an internal system named "Amazon Dynamo," designed for high availability, fault tolerance, and consistent performance despite hardware failures or network issues.

In 2007, Amazon's engineers unveiled their work in a paper titled "Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store." This publication outlined Dynamo's construction principles, attracting significant attention in tech circles. It fueled discussions on distributed databases, NoSQL, and database scalability.

Recognizing growing interest in scalable, available databases, Amazon leveraged their technology for external use via Amazon Web Service (`AWS`). In 2012, Amazon introduced Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service on AWS. Developers could delegate database management complexities while leveraging Dynamo's core principles.

## Main Features

DynamoDB has rapidly become a favorite among startups, enterprises, and developers who are in search of reliable and scalable databases, all while avoiding the challenges of managing infrastructure. Its adaptability across various applications, ranging from mobile apps to real-time analytics, has been a key factor in driving its widespread adoption.

By utilizing DynamoDB, developers are liberated from the intricacies of handling both hardware and software components. The platform takes on the intricate task of scaling partitions and re-partitioning data to align with the specific throughput requirements. It accomplishes this seamless scaling without necessitating manual intervention for re-partitioning tables. This automatic process guarantees consistently low latency access to your data, with response times typically in the single-digit millisecond range.

The list below includes but is not limited to some of the most important features that DynamoDB offers it's customers.

|    Features      |              Description                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Key-Value Store | In a Key-Value database data is organized as pairs, with a unique "key" serving as an identifier and the corresponding "value" storing the data. Keys and values can be simple or complex objects. Key-value databases, like Amazon DynamoDB, can easily scale horizontally by adding partitions, enabling them to handle immense amounts of data, unlike some other database types. For instance, DynamoDB automatically adds partitions to a table when needed for increased storage capacity. |
| Managed NoSQL Database | DynamoDB allows you to easily scale up or down based on your application's needs, without requiring you to provision hardware. |
| High Availability | It offers built-in high availability and data durability by automatically replicating data across multiple Availability Zones. |
| Data Replication | DynamoDB supports global tables, enabling you to replicate data across multiple AWS regions for low-latency access from anywhere. |
| On-Demand Capacity | You can choose to pay for read and write capacity by actual usage, known as on-demand capacity mode. |
| Provisioned Capacity | Alternatively, you can provision a specific amount of read and write capacity to handle predictable workloads. |
| Auto Scaling | DynamoDB can automatically adjust capacity to handle traffic spikes without manual intervention. |
| Data Encryption | Data at rest is encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Additionally, data in transit can be encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). |
| Fine-Grained Access Control | You can control access to tables and resources using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and fine-grained access control policies. |
| Flexible Schema | DynamoDB's schema-less nature allows you to add or remove attributes from items without altering the database schema. |
| Fully Managed Backups | DynamoDB provides continuous backups and enables point-in-time recovery to protect your data. |
| Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) | GSIs enable you to create alternative query patterns for your data, improving query performance. |
| Local Secondary Indexes (LSI) | LSIs provide another way to query your data, but they are limited to items with the same partition key as the base table. |
| In-Memory Acceleration with DAX | DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is an in-memory cache that can significantly improve read performance. |
| Time-to-Live (TTL) | You can configure items to expire automatically after a specified amount of time. |
| Streams | DynamoDB Streams capture changes to the data in real-time, allowing you to react to changes or perform data analysis. |
| Cross-Region Replication | You can replicate tables across regions for disaster recovery or to serve global users with low-latency access. |
| Triggers with AWS Lambda | You can configure triggers to invoke AWS Lambda functions in response to changes in the DynamoDB table. |
| Consistent and Eventually Consistent Reads | DynamoDB offers two types of read consistency options for different application needs. |


## Market Comparison

In this section i will be comparing AWS DynamoDB with Oracle NoSQL Database pricing models and the technical aspects that they both incorporate.

### Provisioned Capacity Pricing Model

Provisioned capacity in the context of databases refers to the pre-allocated resources that you set up to handle the anticipated workload of read and write operations on your database.

In other words, when you provision capacity for a database, you are specifying the amount of computing resources (such as processing power, memory, and storage) that should be dedicated to handling the data access operations. This capacity is allocated based on your expected usage patterns, traffic volume, and performance requirements.

Some of the key points about provisioned capacity are:
1. **Predictable Performance**: By provisioning a set amount of capacity, you can ensure consistent and predictable performance for your database, as it will have a dedicated amount of resources available at all times.
2. **Cost Predictability**: Provisioned capacity typically comes with a fixed cost associated with the allocated resources. You pay for the capacity you provision, regardless of whether you fully utilize it or not.
3. **Adjustable**: While provisioned capacity provides a baseline level of performance, many cloud database services allow you to adjust the provisioned capacity up or down as your needs change. This allows you to scale your resources to match changes in traffic or workload.
4. **Capacity Planning**: Provisioned capacity often requires some level of capacity planning to determine the appropriate amount of resources needed to handle your database's workload effectively.
5. **Optimized for Steady Workloads**: Provisioned capacity is well-suited for workloads that have relatively steady and predictable traffic patterns. It ensures that your application doesn't face performance fluctuations due to sudden spikes in traffic.

One of the drawbacks with provisoned capacity is excess capacity that can lead to over-provisioning which will result in unnecessary costs or provisioning too little capacity which can result in performance bottlenecks during high-demand periods.

## Setting up AWS DynamoDB

To use the DynamoDB service, you must have an AWS account. You're not charged for any AWS services that you sign up for unless you use them.

1. If you don't already have one - [Create a new AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email).
- - Follow the online instructions.<br>Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.<br>When you sign up for an AWS account, an AWS account root user is created. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform tasks that require root user access.
2. [Get an AWS access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SettingUp.DynamoWebService.html#SettingUp.DynamoWebService.GetCredentials)
- - Before you can access DynamoDB programmatically or through the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you must have programmatic access. You don't need programmatic access if you plan to use the DynamoDB console only.
3. [Configure your credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SettingUp.DynamoWebService.html#SettingUp.DynamoWebService.ConfigureCredentials)
- - Before you can access DynamoDB programmatically or through the AWS CLI, you must configure your credentials to enable authorization for your applications.<br>There are several ways to do this. For example, you can manually create the credentials file to store your access key ID and secret access key. You also can use the aws configure command of the AWS CLI to automatically create the file. Alternatively, you can use environment variables. For more information about configuring your credentials, see the programming-specific AWS SDK developer guide.<br>To install and configure the AWS CLI, see [Using the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.CLI.html).

This should get you up and running with AWS DynamoDB Web service.
