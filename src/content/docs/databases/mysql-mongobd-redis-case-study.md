- 1995: First version released by MySQL AB. 
- 1998 to 2008: Several production releases, establishing itself as a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
- 2010: Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems triggers MySQL fork into MariaDB, alongside MySQL Server 5.5 enhancements.
- 2018: MySQL Server 8.0 announces major features like the NoSQL Document Store and improved sorting.

### MongoDB
- 2007: MongoDB founded by Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz, and Kevin Ryan. 
- 2009: Launched as an open-source development platform. 
- 2015: Released MongoDB version 3.0 with WiredTiger Storage Engine.
- 2016-2022: New releases every year during this period.
- 2022: MongoDB released version 6.0 with significant updates, including Atlas Serverless instances and the Atlas Data API.


## Main Features

### MySQL

MySQL is a leading Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) utilizing Structured Query Language (SQL) and developed as open-source software. MySQL is known for its performance, reliability, and user-friendliness. Widely used across diverse applications, from personal projects to high-profile websites, offering compatibility with various operating systems and flexible deployment options. Adhering to SQL standards, MySQL excels in speed, scalability, and ease of use, making it ideal for web-based applications.

| Pros                                                        | Cons                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability and Flexibility:** Scales from embedded to massive data warehouses with customization options.  | **Limited Handling of Large Data:** Impact performance and scalability with very large datasets. |
| **High Performance:** Delivers exceptional performance for various applications.| **Absence of SQL Check Constraints:** Challenge data integrity without native support. |
| **High Availability:** Ensures constant uptime with robust reliability features.| **Transaction Inefficiency and Data Corruption:** Risk data reliability due to transaction issues. |
| **Robust Transactional Support:** Provides powerful transactional capabilities for data integrity.| **Feature Limitations in Older Versions:** Hampers application development lacking essential features. |
| **Web and Data Warehouse Strengths:** Excels in high-traffic web and data warehousing environments.| **Scalability Challenges:** Limits usability for growing systems. |
| **Strong Data Protection:** Offers extensive security features for data privacy and integrity.| **Weaknesses in Stored Procedures:** Impacts application performance and maintainability. |
| **Comprehensive Application Development:** Supports various development needs with multiple features.| **Complex Database Cluster Installation:** Challenging and resource-intensive cluster setup and maintenance. |
| **Management Ease:** Provides quick installation, self-management, and graphical tools for administration.| **Issues with Group By Functionality:** Complicates query development and result accuracy due to inconsistent behaviour. |


### MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source, cross-platform NoSQL database designed for scalability and flexibility. Developed by the owners of DoubleClick to overcome limitations of SQL databases, MongoDB stores data in collections and documnets It features JSON-like documents with optional schemas, hierarchical storage, and superior speed compared to relational databases. While offering agility and performance advantages, it may pose a learning curve for users accustomed to SQL.

| Pros                                                        | Cons                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalable:** Effortlessly scales to handle growing data and user loads. | **High Storage Usage:** Consumes significant storage due to its document-oriented model. |
| **High Performance:** Ensures quick storage and retrieval of complex data. | **Security Concerns:** May pose security challenges if not properly configured. |
| **Flexible:** Schema-less design simplifies storage and querying of diverse data structures. | **Complex Joins:** Joining documents can impact query performance. |
| **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with popular programming languages. | **Size Constraint:** Imposes a limit of 16MB on document size. |
| **Reliable:** Ensures data availability and reliability through robust replication. | **Nesting Limitations:** Restrictions apply to document nesting. |
| **Multi-language Support:** Provides official drivers for multiple programming languages, facilitating seamless multi-language support. | **Troubleshooting Challenges:** Can pose difficulties in troubleshooting due to limited community support. |
| **Comprehensive:** Provides extensive functionality for data analysis and reporting. | **Query Language Complexity:** MongoDB's query language (MQL) can present challenges in comprehension. |
| **Developer-friendly:** Prioritizes ease-of-use and productivity for developers. | **Data Consistency:** The absence of native transactions may result in inconsistencies.|
