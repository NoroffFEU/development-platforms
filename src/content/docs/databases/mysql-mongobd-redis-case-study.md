## Brief History

### MySQL
- 1994: MySQL development begins by Widenious and Axmark.
- 1995: First version released by MySQL AB. 
- 1998 to 2008: Several production releases, establishing itself as a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
- 2010: Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems triggers MySQL fork into MariaDB, alongside MySQL Server 5.5 enhancements.
- 2018: MySQL Server 8.0 announces major features like the NoSQL Document Store and improved sorting.


## Main Features

### MySQL

MySQL is a leading Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) utilizing Structured Query Language (SQL) and developed as open-source software. MySQL is known for its performance, reliability, and user-friendliness. Widely used across diverse applications, from personal projects to high-profile websites, offering compatibility with various operating systems and flexible deployment options. Adhering to SQL standards, MySQL excels in speed, scalability, and ease of use, making it ideal for web-based applications.
