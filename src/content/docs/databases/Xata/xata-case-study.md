## Introduction

<b>Postgres, powered up.</b> The X in Xata stands for extended data, and built on top of PostgreSQL (uses PostgreSQL under the hood to store your data), Xata is a serverless data platform designed for developers to make building easy. Xata provides the best free plan in the industry and is production ready by default. It's easy to upgrade when your project needs to scale, and in addition to the free plan(Best for personal projects and new ideas.) they offer Pro(A usage based plan built for small to medium sized teams.) that starts at 20$ per month, and Enterprise(Best for high scale use cases and large teams.) that has custom pricing. <br>
It's open source and built with features that simplify complex database management tasks. It plugs easily into your favorite front-end frameworks and platforms.

### Mission

"Our mission is to radically simplify the way developers work with data. Your database can do more than store rows and columns in a table. We want to remove the glue out of your stack and provide a connected data platform that works with the tools you love."

### Purpose

"Our purpose as a company is to make databases a joy to use for everyone building an app today, not just a select few."

## Conclusion

When looking for a platform offering a free plan I landed on the fairly new alternative Xata. It proves to be a great choice for developers wanting to build an application with a serverless database, starting out with no billed plan witch is a great feature for new developers testing out their product. For high traffic platforms with bigger data storage it might face higher costs compared to traditional databases. As a new developer myself I find Xata to be a platform I will use for my upcoming projects based on what I've learned.

### Advantages

- Discord channel maintained by by the Xata team where you can get help, showcase your work and get into discussions.
- Built-in full-text search
- Serverless architecture
- Flexible data model, ideal for apps needing both structure and flexibility
- Real-time collaborations, allowing multiple users working on the same data
- Branching, allowing users to create isolated environments for testing, staging or development, similar to Git.
- User-friendly API
- Query ChatGPT against your data, OpenAI embedded in your database bu default.
- Start free, pay as you grow

### Limitations

- Xata provides SQL-like querying but does not offer direct SQL support, which can be restrictive for developers familiar with traditional SQL databases and needing advanced SQL queries.
- As a serverless platform, costs can accumulate based on usage. For applications with extremely high query loads or large data storage needs, pricing could become a factor compared to more traditional databases.
- As a newer platform, Xata has a smaller developer community and ecosystem compared to established databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL
