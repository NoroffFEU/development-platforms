# Getting started with Flutter

## Step-by-Step Guide

This guide assumes the reader is using VSC as code editor.

### 1. Install Visual Studio Code (VSC)

- Download VSC from [Visual Studio Code's official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 2. Install Flutter

- **Download Flutter SDK**: Visit [Flutter's official website](https://flutter.dev) and download the Flutter SDK.
- **Extract the SDK**: Place it in a desired location (e.g., `C:\src\flutter`). Avoid directories like `C:\Program Files\`.
- **Update Path**: Add Flutter to your system's path.
  - [Example for Windows systems](https://www.codecademy.com/article/install-flutter-sdk-on-windows).
  - [Example for macOS systems](https://www.codecademy.com/article/install-flutter-sdk-for-mac).
  - [Example for Linux systems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73019725/how-to-install-flutter-on-linux-mint).
- **Run Flutter Doctor**: Execute `flutter doctor` in the terminal to check your environment.

### 3. Install Flutter and Dart Plugins

- Open VSC.
- Navigate to `View -> Extensions`.
- Search and install the `Flutter` extension by Dart Code (this will also install Dart).

### 4. Set Up an Emulator or a Real Device

- **Emulator**: Use Android Studio or Xcode for emulation.
- **Real Device**: Connect a device with developer options and USB debugging enabled.

### 5. Create a New Flutter Project

- In VSC, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
- Select `Flutter: New Project`.
- Enter a project name and location.

### 6. Run Your App

- VSC opens the main Dart file of the new project.
- Select a device from the device selector in the status bar.
- Start the app with for debugging by using `F5` or by executing `flutter run` in the terminal.

### 7. Explore Flutter

- Modify the code in the main Dart file.
- Save changes for hot-reload.

### 8. Practice Dart

- Practice Dart programming using resources like [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/).

### 9. Explore Flutter Documentation and Community

- Visit [Flutter's website](https://docs.flutter.dev/) for documentation.
- Join Flutter communities for support and collaboration.
