## Introduction

**This is how Astro explains itself**

"Astro is a web framework that takes the best from the early internet (think HTML and CSS) and puts it to work in a next-gen architecture to make every Astro site, and the whole web, faster. Whereas most frameworks today are designed for web apps, Astro is built for content-rich sites where performance matters most. Pull content from anywhere, deploy everywhere, and let's build the web we want, together."
