# "There’s a simple secret to building a faster website — just ship less."

_-Fred Schott & Nate Moore (Founders of Astro)_

## Introduction

**This is how Astro explains itself:**

_"Astro is a web framework that takes the best from the early internet (think HTML and CSS) and puts it to work in a next-gen architecture to make every Astro site, and the whole web, faster. Whereas most frameworks today are designed for web apps, Astro is built for content-rich sites where performance matters most. Pull content from anywhere, deploy everywhere, and let's build the web we want, together."_

Unlike a lot of frameworks that is created based on Javascript, Astro produces zero Javascript by default. It emphasizes on HTML-first design philosophy, and renders your entire page to static HTML during the build. This all results in much faster load times, since the browser reads the website as static HTML. Should client-side Javascript be necessary (lets say shopping carts, image carousels etc), Astro will only load in the specific components and dependencies needed for the job.
