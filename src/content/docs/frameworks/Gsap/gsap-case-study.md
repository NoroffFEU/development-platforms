The GreenSock Animation Platform, also known as “GSAP”, is a powerful JavaScript library that enables users to create visually stunning and seamless animations. Created by Jack Doyle, it was initially meant as a small, helpful tool for developers, but has since evolved into one of the most popular libraries in the animation landscape, being utilized on over millions of sites.

With the ability to animate virtually everything Javascript can interact with, like CSS, SVG, strings, colors, objects and much more, GSAP gives designers and frontend developers a creative toolset to create a dynamic and engaging site.
