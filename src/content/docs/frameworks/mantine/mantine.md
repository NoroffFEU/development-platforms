Why Choose Mantine?

   performance in large applications. Material UI, while feature-rich, can result in larger bundle
   sizes.

2. Over Chakra UI
   Mantine UI has a larger number of pre-built components and built-in hooks, covering more advanced UI elements such as notifications and modals.

3. Over Radix UI
   Comes with styles while still being flexible. Mantine supports dark color schemes and custom themes.
