## Introduction

Tauri is an open-source framework for building lightweight, secure, and cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At its core, Tauri leverages Rust, a systems programming language whose focus on memory safety—without relying on a garbage collector—makes it an excellent fit for Tauri's backend. This enables efficient resource management and robust security. By combining Rust with native web renderers, Tauri provides developers with a modern, high-performance alternative to frameworks like Electron, offering significantly reduced application size and improved execution speed.

Since its launch, Tauri has become a popular choice for developers seeking a secure and efficient solution for cross-platform application development.

## Tauri vs Electron

A detailed comparison between Tauri and it's main competitor Electron was conducted using a real-world application, Authme—a simple cross-platform two-factor authenticator app for desktop. This comparison highlights that while Tauri offers advantages in bundle size, startup time, and security, it may require developers to adapt to Rust for backend development and address potential rendering inconsistencies across platforms. Electron, with its mature ecosystem and consistent rendering, remains a robust choice, especially for those already proficient in JavaScript.

### Bundle Size

- Tauri: The installer is approximately 2.5 MB, resulting in a significantly smaller application bundle.
- Electron: The installer is around 85 MB, leading to larger application sizes.

### Startup Time

- Tauri: Approximately 2 seconds.
- Electron: Approximately 4 seconds.

### Performance

- Tauri: Lower RAM usage (~80 MB) and minimal CPU and GPU usage when idle.
- Electron: Higher RAM usage (~120 MB) with similar CPU and GPU usage when idle.

### App Backend

- Tauri: Requires backend development in Rust, which may present a learning curve for developers unfamiliar with the language.
- Electron: Allows backend development in JavaScript using the Node.js runtime, which may be more accessible for web developers.

### Rendering

- Tauri: Utilizes the system's native webview (Edge Webview2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux, and WebKit on macOS), which may lead to inconsistencies across platforms due to varying support for web standards.
- Electron: Bundles Chromium, ensuring consistent rendering across all platforms.

### Security

- Tauri: Offers enhanced security features by default, including explicit enabling or disabling of certain APIs.
- Electron: Provides full access to Node.js APIs, which could pose security risks if not properly managed.

### Auto-Update

- Tauri: Includes a built-in auto-updater, though it may require maintaining a custom update server or manually updating a JSON file.
- Electron: Commonly uses electron-updater, which can pull binaries from GitHub releases, offering a more streamlined update process.

### Developer Experience

- Tauri: Provides a comprehensive CLI with features like hot reload, cross-platform building, and app icon generation. Compatible with any web framework.
- Electron: Offers the core framework, but additional setup is required for features like hot reloading and bundling.

## Weaknesses

While Tauri offers significant advantages, it does have some limitations:

- **Learning Curve for Rust**: Developers unfamiliar with Rust may find it challenging to implement backend functionality.
- **Dependency on Native Webviews**: Application performance can vary depending on the operating system’s webview.
- **Smaller Ecosystem**: Tauri has fewer plugins and third-party tools compared to Electron, which can increase development time.
- **Limited Documentation for Advanced Use Cases**: Developers tackling complex projects might find a lack of resources for niche scenarios.
- **Manual Setup for Auto-Updates**: Tauri’s auto-update mechanism requires more manual effort compared to Electron’s streamlined solutions.
