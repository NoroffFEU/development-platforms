## Introduction

Vercel is a cloud platform that provides developers with tools to build, deploy, and scale modern web applications seamlessly. It enables rapid prototyping and deployment of web projects, making it particularly popular for frontend-focused applications. Common use cases include deploying marketing websites, e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and dynamic web applications. Vercel's close integration with frameworks like Next.js allows developers to build performant, server-rendered applications with ease. It is particularly popular among frontend developers and is well-suited for frameworks like Next.js, which Vercel co-develops. This case study delves into Vercel’s history, features, strengths, weaknesses, and its position in the competitive landscape of development platforms.

## Brief History
