## Introduction

Netlify started their journey of web hosting back in 2014. Founded by Mathias Biilmann and Christian Bach, two guys who used to run a web development agency, Netlify has been making web development easier and faster since 2015. Netlify is all about helping people put websites online using static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Brief History

- **2014**: When Mathias Biilmann shifted from a career in music and journalism to engineering, teaming up with Christian Bach, it wasn't just a career change, it marked the birth of Netlify. At this early stage, their vision was clear: they aimed to simplify the web development process for developers across the globe by using modern technology stacks and automation. They saw that the significant gap in the industry—deploying modern web projects was inefficient, especially for projects relying heavily on static content. By addressing this gap, Netlify was able to enhance developer productivity.

- **2015**: The official launch of Netlify was a defining moment.
  At the time, the technological landscape was full with innovations, yet the integration of continuous deployment tools with static site generation was still in its early stages. Netlify’s offerings were met with enthusiasm by the developer community. However, the company faced initial challenges, such as convincing developers accustomed to traditional web hosting services to switch to a Git-based workflow and static site architecture.

- **2016**: The $2.1 million raised from tech influencers and venture capital in 2016 provided Netlify with validation and the financial resources to scale their operations. This investment was strategically utilized to enhance their platform’s capabilities, such as improving the scalability of their infrastructure and expanding their feature set to include more automation tools. This phase of strategic growth helped cement Netlify’s reputation as a reliable and innovative platform.

- **2017**: The rebranding from MakerLoop to Netlify in 2017, coupled with a substantial $12 million investment led by Andreessen Horowitz, marked a significant transformation in the company's trajectory. The rebranding reflected a broader vision and maturity, signaling Netlify's transition from a niche tool for static sites to a fully equipped web development platform.

- **2018**: In 2018, Netlify began to promote the concept of Jamstack—a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup. This approach fit perfectly with Netlify’s philosophy and existing features, such as static site hosting and serverless functions. Focusing on Jamstack not only set Netlify apart from competitors but also showcased their commitment to using cutting-edge technologies to redefine the web development trends.

- **2021**: A year for acquisitions, Netlify expanded its arsenal by acquiring FeaturePeek and OneGraph. These strategic moves enhanced its offerings, enabling developers to preview front-end content easily and integrate various APIs through GraphQL composition.

- **2022**: Continued to expand its offerings by adding Quirrel, an open-source service for managing serverless functions and jobs, to its portfolio. This addition, alongside the incorporation of competitors like Jamstack Frameworks and Gatsby, solidified Netlify's commitment to web development.

- **2023**: Introducing a brand new, modern API, built on web platform standards, that will improve the developer experience of writing functions. Also AI-powered development tools designed to further enhance the web development process are being developed.

## Main Features of Netlify

Netlify is full of different features and is like a box of toys ready to be played with.

- **Git-Centric Deployment**: Integrating perfectly with Git repositories, Netlify offers workflow that allows for both hosting and deployment. Changes pushed to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket can automatically trigger builds and updates, simplifying development.

Real-World Example of Git-Centric Workflow:
Suppose a developer is working on a new feature in their local development environment. Once the feature is ready, the developer commits the changes to their Git repository and pushes these commits to a specific branch (e.g., 'main'). This action triggers an automatic process on Netlify:

- Webhook Notification: Netlify listens for push events on the linked repository. Once changes are detected, Netlify initiates the deployment process.
- Build Process: Netlify retrieves the latest code from the repository and runs the build commands defined in the project's configuration (such as compiling SASS files, minifying JavaScript, or generating static content from site generators).
- Deployment: After the build completes, Netlify deploys the updated files to its Content Delivery Network (CDN). This ensures that the updated version of the website is distributed across various geographical locations for faster access.
- Live Update: The new version of the site goes live almost instantly after the build, with zero downtime due to Netlify's atomic deployments, where updates are either entirely successful or rolled back without affecting the live site.

- **Serverless Functions**: Netlify's serverless functions provide a powerful way to run backend code without the hassle of managing a server's infrastructure. These functions are event-driven, executing in response to various triggers such as HTTP requests, scheduled events, or even changes in data.
- Example of a Serverless Function on Netlify:
  Consider a scenario where a website needs to handle form submissions without deploying a backend server. The developer can write a Netlify serverless function in JavaScript that:
- Triggers on Form Submission: When a user submits a form on the website, the form data is sent as a POST request to a serverless function endpoint hosted on Netlify.
- Processes Data: The function receives the form data, processes it (e.g., validation, logging, or sending an email notification), and perhaps stores it in a database or forwards it to another API.
- Responds to the Client: After processing, the function sends a response back to the client, such as a confirmation message or error information if the submission was invalid.

- **Scalability**: It grows with your site thanks to global CDN.

- **Security Measures**: Automatic HTTPS and ongoing monitoring keep things secure.

- **Forms Handling**: Simplifying data collection, Netlify’s form handling capabilities makes it easy to gather data with built-in form tools.

- **Collaboration and Preview Tools**: Share previews of updates before they go live.

- **Continuous Deployment**: Netlify’s continuous deployment feature automates the build and deployment process each time you push code changes, keeping your site up-to-date.

- **Analytics and Monitoring**: Keeps an eye on how your site's doing right from the dashboard. Understand user behaviors, track site health, and optimize for better performance and user experience directly from your dashboard.

By combining management with developer-friendly features, Netlify not only simplifies web development but also opens up new possibilities for building more dynamic and scalable web applications.
