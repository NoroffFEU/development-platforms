## Summary

This is my video case study on AWS S3, Simple Storage Service. I go through how to set up an account with AWS and a simple guide on how to use S3 with the provided console from AWS, as well as how to access the stored data with an SDK provided from AWS using JavaScript.

I also do a short pros and cons about AWS and S3 throughout the video, and towards the end i do a small comparison of alternative services that directly compete with S3.
