## Introduction To WordPress
Everyone who browses the internet have come across Wordpress many times, the reason behind this is that this platform is responsible for over 40% of all existing websites on the internet. If we listen to Google on this topic, then Google would provide us with a statement which says “As of 2024, there are 810 million WordPress websites”. Which is a pretty big number for only one development platform. Because of this we will have a deep dive into Wordpress and why it is one of the most popular website development platforms in the world. So strap in.

## Quick History Of Wordpress
The history of Wordpress begins on May 27, 2003 where Wordpress was lunched and co-founded by Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little. Both of the founders of Wordpress are web developers and had various experience in web development before co-founding Wordpress. The reason why they created Wordpress was to simplify website creation and blogging was was gaining in popularity in the early 2000s.

When Wordpress was lunched it was based on an already existing blogging platform  called “b2/cafelog”. But it wouldn't take long before Wordpress started to get software updates like in 2004 with “Wordpress 1.0” which was the first updated version of the platform which gave a fair share of changes to the users. One of the biggest changes to the Wordpress with the “Wordpress 1.0” was a search-engine-friendly permalinks that search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing amongst other search engines could recognize easily

In 2005, Wordpress got another major update which was named “Wordpress 2.0” where it introduced something called “What you see is what you get” or “WYSIWYG” for short. This feature was to help website authors with no web development skills to edit content in a single WordPress dashboard and change in a simple way how their websites looked like.

In 2010, the users of Wordpress got another software updated called “Wordpress 3.0”. This updated had a lighter interface than what previous updates and versions of Wordpress were offering. “Wordpress 3.0” also offered users a bulk plugin updates which every user could use as well as contextual help on each screen. Its important to say that this software update in a way proved the power of the WordPress community since there were more than 200 contributors who have helped to achieve this software update.

2014 was in a way a boring year, since the “Wordpress 4.0” didn't offer big changes to the platform but rather add some minor extra functionalities which would make the user experience smoother and more user-friendly.

4 years later in 2018, we had received “Wordpress 5.0” had given the users a big change which is called “Gutenberg” which was the customizable block-based editor of the layout.  This have offered a more smooth and easier to control process of creating how your website would look like for readers of your website. This was made possible by giving each visible content on the website their own box which the owner of the website could rearrange without changing anything else of the website’s layout.

At the time of writing, the latest software updated happened in 2022 with the “Wordpress 6.0”. This software updated focused on the writing experience of the platform. “Wordpress 6.0” have added a range of pretty decent amount of features to simplify content writing and creation.
