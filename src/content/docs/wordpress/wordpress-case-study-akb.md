## Introduction To WordPress
Everyone who browses the internet have come across Wordpress many times, the reason behind this is that this platform is responsible for over 40% of all existing websites on the internet. If we listen to Google on this topic, then Google would provide us with a statement which says “As of 2024, there are 810 million WordPress websites”. Which is a pretty big number for only one development platform. Because of this we will have a deep dive into Wordpress and why it is one of the most popular website development platforms in the world. So strap in.

## Quick History Of Wordpress
The history of Wordpress begins on May 27, 2003 where Wordpress was lunched and co-founded by Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little. Both of the founders of Wordpress are web developers and had various experience in web development before co-founding Wordpress. The reason why they created Wordpress was to simplify website creation and blogging was was gaining in popularity in the early 2000s.

When Wordpress was lunched it was based on an already existing blogging platform  called “b2/cafelog”. But it wouldn't take long before Wordpress started to get software updates like in 2004 with “Wordpress 1.0” which was the first updated version of the platform which gave a fair share of changes to the users. One of the biggest changes to the Wordpress with the “Wordpress 1.0” was a search-engine-friendly permalinks that search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing amongst other search engines could recognize easily

In 2005, Wordpress got another major update which was named “Wordpress 2.0” where it introduced something called “What you see is what you get” or “WYSIWYG” for short. This feature was to help website authors with no web development skills to edit content in a single WordPress dashboard and change in a simple way how their websites looked like.

In 2010, the users of Wordpress got another software updated called “Wordpress 3.0”. This updated had a lighter interface than what previous updates and versions of Wordpress were offering. “Wordpress 3.0” also offered users a bulk plugin updates which every user could use as well as contextual help on each screen. Its important to say that this software update in a way proved the power of the WordPress community since there were more than 200 contributors who have helped to achieve this software update.

2014 was in a way a boring year, since the “Wordpress 4.0” didn't offer big changes to the platform but rather add some minor extra functionalities which would make the user experience smoother and more user-friendly.

4 years later in 2018, we had received “Wordpress 5.0” had given the users a big change which is called “Gutenberg” which was the customizable block-based editor of the layout.  This have offered a more smooth and easier to control process of creating how your website would look like for readers of your website. This was made possible by giving each visible content on the website their own box which the owner of the website could rearrange without changing anything else of the website’s layout.

At the time of writing, the latest software updated happened in 2022 with the “Wordpress 6.0”. This software updated focused on the writing experience of the platform. “Wordpress 6.0” have added a range of pretty decent amount of features to simplify content writing and creation. 

## Main Features Of WordPress.com and WordPress.org
Users of Wordpress can choose between 2 options when they want to create their websites with Wordpress. And those 2 options are either “WordPress.com” and “WordPress.org”.

WordPress.com and WordPress.org serve different purposes and have distinct features which depends on individual needs for their websites. So we will take a quick look at what makes WordPress.com and WordPress.org different

### WordPress.com
Hosting = WordPress.com is a hosted platform which means your website is hosted on WordPress’s servers.
Cost = WordPress.com offers users a free plan with basic features but if you look for something more advanced it requires you to choose between 4 different paid plans which varies in the price and what each individual paid plan offers.
Ease of Use = WordPress.com offers its users a more user-friendly for beginners with minimal setup. This makes WordPress.com more suitable for users who want to create a site without technical knowledge in web development.
Customization = WordPress.com has a limit when it comes for the free plan and various themes and plugins. This one can be solved with the 4 different paid plans which offer you more options to choose from.

Maintenance = WordPress.com offers a automatically done updates and backups that are handed by WordPress.com which reduces the maintenance responsibilities for the users. 

### WordPress.org
Hosting = WordPress.org is self-hosted. Which means that the users need to find their own web hosting provider and install WordPress software.
Cost = WordPress.org is free to download and use. But when it comes to hosting, domain registration and any premium themes and plugins means the users need to pay.
Ease of Use = WordPress.org requires that its users have more technical knowledge for web development, setup and management which means it isn't as beginner friendly as Wordpress.com

## WordPress compared to other Similar platforms 
There is many of similar platforms to WordPress like Wix, Squarespace, Joomla, Shopify and Drupal to name a few of those similar platforms. 

Wix offers the same drag-and-drop interface as Wordpress. The customization is very limited compared to WordPress. The SEI capabilities of six are very basic and not as what WordPress has to offer. And the flexibility of wix, isn't that good if we compare it to what Wordpress has to offer.

Squarespace has a user-friendly interface with good looking templates. The customization of Squarespace is very limited when compared to WordPress. Squarespace has a pretty solid SEO capabilities but they aren't as expositive as the one Wordpress has with its plugins. And Squarespace is good for small businesses and portfolios but the moment the websites start to get larger there would be various problems which doesn't happen on Wordpress.

Joomla is much more or complex than Wordpress, and isn't as beginner friendly as Wordpress is. Joomla offers extensive customization options and flexibility but to do that it requires more technical knowledge. The SEO options are good at Joomla but they aren't as intuitive as what Wordpress has to offer. The security at Joomla requires proactive management and updates.

Shopify is very user friendly, but it has very limited e-commerce features, and they aren't as customizable as WordPress. The SEO capabilities on Shopify are good but they aren't as comprehensive as WordPress for general content. And the flexibility isn't as good and easy to use on Shopify as it is on Wordpress.

Drupal isn't very beginner friendly since it is most suited for with technical expertise in web development. But Drupal is very customizable and flexible, great for complex and large-scale applications. The SEO capabilities of Drupal are good but they requires more configuration than WordPress.

So from what we can see, WordPress os better for users who are looking for a balance between ease of use, customization, and flexibility, making it suitable for various applications.
