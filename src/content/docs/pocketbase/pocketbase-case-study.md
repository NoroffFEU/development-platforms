## Introduction

PocketBase represents a big shift in backend development, offering developers an open source backend in 1 file with realtime database, authentication, file storage and admin dashboard. This approach to backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solutions challenges traditional multi-component architectures by consolidating essential backend functionality into a single executable file.

Built with Go and utilizing SQLite as its embedded database, PocketBase addresses the growing need for lighweight , self-hosted backend solutions that can be deployed quickly without complex infrastructure requirements. It combines an embedded SQLite database with data validation, real-time subscriptions, and an easy to use REST API, along with authentication and file storage, making it a particularly attractive for rapid prototyping and small to medium sized projects.

## Brief History
