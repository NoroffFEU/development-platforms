## Introduction

PocketBase represents a big shift in backend development, offering developers an open source backend in 1 file with realtime database, authentication, file storage and admin dashboard. This approach to backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solutions challenges traditional multi-component architectures by consolidating essential backend functionality into a single executable file.

Built with Go and utilizing SQLite as its embedded database, PocketBase addresses the growing need for lighweight , self-hosted backend solutions that can be deployed quickly without complex infrastructure requirements. It combines an embedded SQLite database with data validation, real-time subscriptions, and an easy to use REST API, along with authentication and file storage, making it a particularly attractive for rapid prototyping and small to medium sized projects.

## Brief History

While specific founding dates and detailed timeline information for PocketBase are limited in public documentation, the project has gained significant traction in the devopler community:

- Early 2022: PocketBase emerges as an open-source project written in Go, focusing on simplicity and developer experience.
- December 2022: The project gets wider recognition when featured in a Fireship video calling it "the ultimate side-project backend", Fireship is a big Youtuber with 4 million subscribers.
- 2023-2024: Active development continues with regular updates and feature additions.
- 2024: PocketBase becomes a popular alternative to traditional BaaS solutions like Firebase and Supabase.
- 2025: Migration guides from Firebase to PocketBase highlight significant cost advantages and simplified deployment.

## Main Features

PocketBase solves the complexity problem inherent in traditional backend development by unifying multiple services into one cohesive solution. Its unique single-file architecture eliminates the need for separate database servers, authentication services, and file storage solutions.

- **Single File Deployment:** The entire backend runs from one executable file, eliminating complex deployment procedures and infrastructure managament.
- **Embedded SQLite Database:** Performant database with data validation, real-time subscriptions and easy to use REST API.
- **Real-Time Subscriptions:** Built-in WebSocket support for real time-data synchronization across clients.
- **Authentication System:** Supports 15+ OAuth2 providers including Google, Apple, Facebook, GitHub and more.
- **File Storage:** Store files locally or in S3 storage, easily attach media to database records and generate thumbnails on the go.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Web-based interface for database management and system administration.
- **Restful API:** Automatic API generation based on database schema.
- **Extensibility:** Can be used as a standalone app or as Go framework with custom business logic.

## Market Comparison

PocketBase fundamentally changes the development approach by eliminating the need to architect, configure, and maintain separate services for databases, authentication, and file storage. Traditional stacks offer greater flexibility in technology choices, better scalability options, mature tooling ecosystems, and enterprise support, but require significantly more setup and operational knowledge.

**Firebase**

PocketBase's primary advantage is its huge cost reduction, a typical 100,000 user application costs $200-500 monthly on Firebase versus $10-50 for PocketBase hosting. Additionally, it provides complete data ownership through self-hosting and eliminates vendor lock-in. However, Firebase excels in massive scale handling with global CDN, extensive ecosystem integrations, advanced analytics, and managed infrastructure with automatic scaling.

**Supabase**

The key distinction here is architectural philosophy, PocketBase offers a single-file, SQLite-based solution that prioritizes simplicity and self-containment making it ideal for developers who want minimal operational overhead. Supabase provides a PostgreSQL-based platform with advanced SQL features, larger ecosystem and enterprise-ready capabilities better suited for complex applications requiring sophisticated database operations.

## Getting Started

PocketBase provides official SDK (Software Development Kits) clients for Javascript, Flutter and other languages, making integration straightforward regardless of frontend technology choice.

Getting started with PocketBase is really straighforward, which shows its core philosophy of simplicity:

**1. Download:** Obtain the single executable file for your operating system from the GitHub releases page
**2. Run:** Execute the binary to starth the server (defaults to port 8090)
**3. Initialize:** Access the admin UI at http://localhost:8090/\_/ to set up your first admin account
**3. Configure:** Create collections (tables) through the web interface or API

Through the admin dashboard you can:

- Define collection schemas with various field types.
- Set up validation rules and access permissions.
- Configure real-time subscription settings
- Generate API documentation automatically.

## Conclusion

PocketBase represents a compelling solution for developers seeking to reduce backend complexity without sacrificing essential features.
The main advantages include dramatically simplified deployment through its single-file architecture, significant cost savings compared to cloud BaaS solutions (up to 90% reduction versus Firebase), complete data ownership and control, rapid development cycles, and freedom from vendor lock-in. The tool's extensive OAuth2 provider support and built-in real-time capabilities make it particularly attractive for modern web applications.
However, PocketBase has notable limitations. It may not scale effectively to enterprise-level traffic due to SQLite constraints, has a smaller ecosystem compared to established solutions, requires operational knowledge for self-hosting, lacks cloud functions support, and doesn't guarantee backward compatibility before reaching v1.0.0.
The primary use cases include rapid prototyping and MVP development, small to medium-sized applications, educational projects, cost-conscious startups, applications requiring data sovereignty, and projects needing quick deployment without infrastructure complexity.
Looking toward the future, PocketBase appears well-positioned to become a significant player in the backend development space. With active development and growing community adoption, its focus on simplicity aligns with current trends toward reduced complexity in software development.
