# Appwrite: The Wedding Quiz Genie

## Introduction

Appwrite is an open-source platform that, among its many capabilities, offers a robust Database as a Service (DBaaS) solution, simplifying data management for developers looking to build web and mobile applications. While it's technically a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) with a broad suite of tools --_including authentication, file storage, and real-time updates_-- its database functionality stands out as a powerful, standalone feature. This document presents a case study examining how Appwrite's database service powered an interactive wedding quiz application, showcased in the GitHub repository [quiz_bryllup](https://github.com/kJAHsin/quiz_bryllup). As the best man at my friend's wedding, I faced the nerve-wracking task of delivering a speech --_not my strong suit_. To ease my nerves and pad out my time in the spotlight, I created this quiz to entertain guests, relying solely on Appwrite's database to store and manage content. This project highlights how Appwrite can streamline data handling and deliver an engaging experience, even for a jittery amateur like yours truly.

## Brief History

Appwrite was launched in 2019 by Eldad Fux as an open-source alternative to proprietary BaaS platforms like Firebase, with a mission to empower developers with flexible, self-hosted backend tools. Its database service, a cornerstone of the platform, has evolved significantly since inception, gaining features like enhanced querying, scalability, and security tailored for modern applications. This growth has been spotlighted in educational content, including YouTube collaborations with developers like Dennis Ivy, who has produced numerous tutorials showcasing Appwrite's capabilities, and Florin Pop, creator of iCodeThis -- the platform that aided me in honing my skills before tackling this project. My wedding quiz application, hosted [here](https://github.com/kJAHsin/quiz_bryllup) and deployed with Netlify, is a personal contribution to this ecosystem. Built to entertain guests at a friend's wedding where I served as best man, it leverages Appwrite's database service to manage quiz content efficiently -- and to save me from stuttering nervously in front of 100 people.

## Main Features

The wedding quiz application leveraged Appwrite's database capabilities to forge an engaging, interactive experience for the guests. Here are some of the key attributes that gave this endeavor life, with focus on how Appwrite's capabilites were utilized:

- **Simplified User Authentication**: Since the quiz was a one-off event, I kept the authentication simple. Guests entered their email, and I pre-set a password to be entered on login.  This allowed me to track individual scores without expecting senior citizens to navigate a registration form before the evening concluded. 

- **Quiz Management**: Appwrite's database powered the quiz by storing and managing all the essential data. I set up collections like _questions_ for quiz items, answers for _response_ options, and _scores_ to track the player's cumulative score. Appwrite's straightforward dashboard made it easy to organize these collections, ensuring the quiz ran smoothly start to finish. No issues whatsoever.

- **Real-Time Scoring**: To keep the energy high, scores updated in real-time as guests submitted their answers. This was made possible by Appwrite's real-time features, which let the application subscribe to database changes and instantly reflect them on the frontend. Here's a small example from the script.js file.
 ```
database.subscribe('collections.scores.documents', (response) => {
  updateScoreUI(response.events);
});
 ```
This code snippet listens for updates to the _scores_ collection and refreshes the UI whenever a new score is recorded, keeping everyone in the loop and the competition lively.

- **Stress-Relief Mechanism**: Beyond the tech, the quiz had a hidden perk --_it helped me sweat less during my speech! While guests were busy tapping away at their phones, fully engrossed in the quiz, I got a few precious minutes to steady my nerves and catch my breath. Appwrite's reliable database kept everything running seamlessly, so I could focus on not melting under pressure.

## Market Comparison

Appwrite goes head-to-head with BaaS giants like Firebase, Supabase, and Parse. Its database service, however, brings some unique panache to the table --_especially when I used it for my wedding quiz project_. Let's break it down:

- **Open-Source Advantage**: Appwrite's open-source vibe is a subtle "stick it to the man" for devs tired of proprietary platforms like Firebase holding their code hostage. It's not merely software, it's also a mild rebellion against vendor lock-in. For my wedding quiz, this meant I could tweak and deploy the database my way. Firebase’s Firestore excels with real-time listeners, making it ideal for apps needing instant updates, whereas Appwrite offers more control over subscriptions, which suited my quiz’s real-time scoring needs. Meanwhile, Supabase leverages PostgreSQL’s relational power, offering advanced querying that Appwrite’s simpler key-value approach doesn’t match.

- **Cost Efficiency**: I built the whole backend (entire app, actually) for free, all thanks to the self-hosting option and free tier. In many cases free tiers are simply bait, but here it was possible to run the entire project without any overhead.
- **Feature Breadth**: Appwrite provides a full suite of services—authentication, database, storage, and real-time updates—similar to Firebase, but with the added flexibility of self-hosting. Supabase, while strong in database management with PostgreSQL, lacks the same breadth of built-in services.
- **Ease of Use**: Appwrite’s intuitive dashboard and well-documented APIs rival Firebase’s developer-friendly experience, though it may require more setup effort due to its self-hosted nature.

### Comparison Table

| Platform   | Open-Source | Self-Hostable | Cost Model         | Key Strength                     |
|------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Appwrite   | Yes         | Yes           | Free (self-hosted) | Flexibility and control          |
| Firebase   | No          | No            | Usage-based        | Seamless integration with Google |
| Supabase   | Yes         | Yes           | Free tier + paid   | PostgreSQL focus                 |

Appwrite’s open-source model and comprehensive feature set make it a standout choice for developers prioritizing customization and cost savings over fully managed cloud solutions. Unlike fully managed solutions like Firebase, Appwrite’s self-hosted nature requires DevOps know-how, which could overwhelm developers new to server management.
