## Introduction to MYSQL

A relational database trusted by developers for its speed, scalability, and open-source flexibility.


This is a case study about the widely known and used open source relational database management system MYSQL. The now world renowned database was founded by the Swedish company MYSQL AB in the 1990´s. More specifically in 1995 by the co-founders, Swedes David Axmark & Allan Larsson and the Finnish Michael “Monty” Widenius. It is said that the creation of MYSQL was a direct response to the lack of reliable, open-source database options at the time. Although MYSQL was not the first open-source database to be created and certainly not the last, MYSQL is the first RDBMS to gain widespread popularity, particularly in the context of web applications.


## Brief History of MYSQL

- 1995: MYSQL was created by the Swedish software company MYSQL AB, led by co-founders David Axmark, Allan Larsson & Michael “Monty” Widenius. 
- 2000: MYSQL was released under the GNU General Public License, making it readily available as open-source software. This move significantly boosted the database's popularity. 
- 2003: MYSQL AB successfully raised $19.5 million in venture capital, which helped accelerate the development and adoption of the database. This year they also saw 4 million installations and 30,000 downloads per day. 
- 2008: MYSQL AB was acquired by Sun Microsystems for approximately $1 billion.
- 2010: Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, including MYSQL. This acquisition raised concerns in the open-source community for the future of MYSQL. 
- 2010: In response to Oracle acquiring MYSQL and out of concern, the open-source community forked the MYSQL database and created a new open-source management system based on its predecessor called MariaDB.  
- 2013: The first release of MYSQL 5.6 was made available, and it introduced performance enhancements, scalable improvements and increased security features. 
- 2021: MYSQL 8.0 became widely adopted, offering advanced features such as support for NOSQL documents stores, better performance optimisation and improved developer productivity.

# Market Comparison: MySQL vs. MariaDB

## Overview

MySQL and MariaDB are both popular open-source relational database management systems. MariaDB was created as a fork of MySQL in 2009, largely in response to concerns over MySQL's acquisition by Oracle Corporation. The two databases share a common origin but have diverged in their development paths.

## Key Differences

- **Ownership and Development:**
  - **MySQL:** Acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010. Development is now managed by Oracle.
  - **MariaDB:** Created by the original MySQL developers as a community-driven fork. It is maintained by the MariaDB Foundation.

- **Licensing:**
  - **MySQL:** Dual-licensed under the GPL and a commercial license.
  - **MariaDB:** Released under the GPL, with a strong commitment to open-source principles.

- **Features and Enhancements:**
  - **MySQL:** Focuses on stability and features aligned with enterprise requirements, with recent versions introducing enhancements like JSON support and improved performance.
  - **MariaDB:** Includes additional features not present in MySQL, such as the Aria storage engine, enhanced performance optimizations, and advanced replication features.
