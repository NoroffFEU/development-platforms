## Introduction

Marker.io is a visual feedback and bug reporting tool primarily used by web development and design teams. It allows users to capture screenshots, annotate them with comments and drawings, and then send them directly to project management or issue tracking tools like Jira, Trello, GitHub, or Asana.

The tool simplifies the process of reporting bugs or providing feedback on websites or web applications by streamlining communication between developers, designers, and stakeholders. Instead of relying on written descriptions of issues, users can visually pinpoint problems or suggest changes, making it easier for teams to understand and address them efficiently.

The story began with 3 friends and a passion for the web.
After building hundreds of websites for all types of clients, we had the idea for Marker.io: a simple way to report bugs on live websites, and collect client feedback along the way.
Fast-forward to today, Marker.io has evolved into a feedback solution for enterprise-scaled organizations.

## Market Comparison

### BugHerd

## Conclutions

Marker.io has established itself as an effective feedback tool, particularly well-suited for smaller teams of three people or fewer. Its niche specialization in the market for visual feedback and bug reporting tools allows it to stand out, not only due to limited competition but also through its distinctive features that aims to help compact teams.
Despite its strengths, potential users should consider the scale of their projects. For larger teams or projects requiring more robust collaboration features and deeper integrative capacities, exploring additional or complementary tools might be necessary to fully address their needs.
