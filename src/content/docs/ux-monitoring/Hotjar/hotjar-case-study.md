## Features

## Weaknesses

Hotjar's data segmentation capabilities are relatively constrained. While you can divide your data by device, country, and other criteria, you might not be able to segment it as precisely as you would like. This can make it challenging to gain a clear sense of how various audiences are interacting with your website.

One of the features that Hotjar lacks is a predictive analysis available in companies similar to Hotjar. Google Analytics is a similar tool that efficiently provides predictions based on the data available and helps users take action on the predictive nature of the audience. This might be why Hotjar does recommend using both their service and Google Analytics.

Hotjar has only a few A/B testing options. While you can use Hotjar to monitor the performance of various pages and elements, you might not be able to do comprehensive A/B testing that lets you choose which version of a page or element performs better based on data.
