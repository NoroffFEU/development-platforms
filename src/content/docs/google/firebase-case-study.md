## Introduction

Firebase began as a startup founded by **James Tamplin and Andrew Lee**. It started with a product called **Envolve**, a tool that enabled developers to add real-time chat to websites. Over time, they realized the underlying technology‚Äîreal-time data sync‚Äîhad broader use cases. This led to the creation of **Firebase Realtime Database**, a platform for syncing app data in real time.
