## Introduction

Firebase began as a startup founded by **James Tamplin and Andrew Lee**. It started with a product called **Envolve**, a tool that enabled developers to add real-time chat to websites. Over time, they realized the underlying technology‚Äîreal-time data sync‚Äîhad broader use cases. This led to the creation of **Firebase Realtime Database**, a platform for syncing app data in real time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get started with Firebase:

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

Go to [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) and click **"Add Project"**.

### 2. Add Firebase SDK to Your Project

#### Web (JavaScript):

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.x.x/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.x.x/firebase-auth.js"></script>
<script>
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "your-app.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-app",
    storageBucket: "your-app.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "SENDER_ID",
    appId: "APP_ID",
  };
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
</script>
```

npm install firebase

```

#### Then in your app:
```

import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

const firebaseConfig = { /_ your config _/ };
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

```

### 3. Enable Products

 - In the Firebase Console, go to the **Build** section.
 - Enable services such as **Authentication**, **Firestore**, **Functions**, etc.

### 4. Use Emulator Suite (optional)

```

npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase init
firebase emulators:start

```
