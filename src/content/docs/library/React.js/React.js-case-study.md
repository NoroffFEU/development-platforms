## Introduction

<img src="/src/assets/frameworks/trpc/react_icon.png" alt="React" icon width="250" height="250">

React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. The UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components. React is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

React is the most used library among developers over the years. React is not a framework; it's a library that exclusively concentrates on the app's user interface layer. To create a complete development toolkit for your project, you still need to select other technologies.

## Getting Started with React

If you're new to React and want to start a new project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**:

   - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download and install it from the official website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install npm (Node.js package manager)**:

   - npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js. To check if you have it installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
     ```
     npm -v
     ```
   - If you see a version number, npm is installed. If not, you can update npm by running:
     ```
     npm install -g npm
     ```

3. **Create a New React Project with Vite**:

   - To start a new React project, you can use the "Vite" tool, which sets up a basic React application with all the necessary configurations and           dependencies. Open your terminal and run:
     ```
     npx create @vitejs/app project-name
     ```

     Replace `project-name` with the desired name of your project. This will create a new directory with the project files.

4. **Navigate to Your Project**:

   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to your project directory:
     ```
     cd project-name
     ```

5. **Start the React Project**:

   - To launch your React project, run the following command:
     ```
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```
     This will start a development server, and your React application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your web      browser.

6. **Edit and Build**:

   - You can start editing your React components and project files. Any changes you make will automatically trigger a hot-reload, meaning you can instantly see the results in your browser. Your project will also be automatically rebuilt.

7. **Deployment**:
   - When you're ready to deploy your React application, you can create a production build using:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
     This will generate optimized, minified, and bundled files in the `build` directory that you can then deploy to a web server.

These steps should help you get started with a new React project. React offers a powerful and flexible environment for building dynamic user interfaces, and the "Create React App" tool simplifies the initial setup process.

## Conclusion

React is well-suited for building user interfaces in web applications, especially those that require interactive and dynamic content. It is often chosen for projects that prioritize reusability, modularity, and a component-based approach.

React's learning curve can be challenging for newcomers to web development and JavaScript frameworks. Additionally, setting up a React project may involve more configuration and choices, which can be overwhelming. While React is flexible, it may not be the ideal choice for smaller projects where the overhead of learning and configuration outweighs the benefits.
