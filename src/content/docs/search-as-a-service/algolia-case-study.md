# Case Study on Algolia

## Introduction

Algolia is a platform I had never heard of before, and was therefore excited to learn more about. As we will discover in this case study, it is a Search-as-a-service platform that delivers AI powered search fuctionality to websites for B2B and retail ecommerce, and is used by big corporations such as Cloudflare, T-Mobile, National Geographics and many more.

I will now adress key events in the platforms history, some of its main functionality and its place in the current Saas market.

## Brief History

- **October 2012**: Algolia is founded by Nicolas Dessaigne and Julien Lemoine based in Paris, France. Originally only focused on offline sarch for mobile phones.
- **March 2014**: Selected as part of Y Combinator's startup accelerator class, which lead to expanding from 2 data centers in Europe to a third in Singapore and with further big investments sice, to over 70 in different regions all over the world.
