# Case Study on Algolia

## Introduction

Algolia is a platform I had never heard of before, and was therefore excited to learn more about. As we will discover in this case study, it is a Search-as-a-service platform that delivers AI powered search fuctionality to websites for B2B and retail ecommerce, and is used by big corporations such as Cloudflare, T-Mobile, National Geographics and many more.

I will now adress key events in the platforms history, some of its main functionality and its place in the current Saas market.

## Brief History

- **October 2012**: Algolia is founded by Nicolas Dessaigne and Julien Lemoine based in Paris, France. Originally only focused on offline sarch for mobile phones.
- **March 2014**: Selected as part of Y Combinator's startup accelerator class, which lead to expanding from 2 data centers in Europe to a third in Singapore and with further big investments sice, to over 70 in different regions all over the world.
- **2017-2020**: Continues expanding globally and launches new products and features, like personalization capabilities, analytics tools and integration with other big dev frameworks and platforms.

- **Now**: Algolia focuses on expanding market presence, serving a wider range of customers.

## Main Features

As the name suggests, Algolia provides search functionality using algorithms and AI to enhance performance. Their main focus is speed and relevance, which is what makes them a SaaS market leader. It works as an API you can implement on your website to get a more advanced search box than just matching search string with product names and describtions. It works by combining samantic search with keyword search.

It uses AI to relate queries to multiple categories and dynamically re-order what shows up first depending on trends, previous searches and global events. Even detect synonyms which can be matched to what the customer is actually trying to find, even with different vocabulary.

- **Query Categorization**: A word may mean more than one thing and can relate to multiple categories. The example used on their website: "Burgundy" can be a region, a wine or a color. Using AI, Algolias search engine will predict the most likely category to show given the context.

- **Dynamic Re-ranking**: Different items, articles or posts may be more or less relevant depending on trends and global events. With machine learning, you are more likely to get content that is trending and on the agenda higher up in the search results.

- **Personalization**: Every user is different, so to optimize relevance, Algolia utilizes user data to build a user profile that takes things like pages viewed, products added to cart, posts liked, etc into account when deciding what to show on each search. This means that three people searching the same query can get three different results that are personalized to their user profile.

- **AI Synonyms**: This ties in with personalization, in the sence that everyone has their own vocabulary and language that can be hard to decode. Algolia uses AI algorithms to dynamically suggest synonyms for keyword search.

## Market Comparison

Search-as-a-service is becoming a large market, expanding with the development of Artificial Inteligence. We can split the market in two categories. Standalone SaaS companies, which include Algolia, Elastic and Solr, and cloud providers offering search solutions, like Amazon and Azure Cognitive Search.

**Standalone**

Companies exclusively providing Search-as-a-service are typically specialized in more relevant technology and innovation, trying to deliver the best solution to the market. Ease of use and extensive documentation are prioritized to make a developer friendly system with intuituve interfaces

Customization is also typically better with standalone companies, allowing their customers to tailor search functionality to their own requirements. As well as allowing their users to customize the product to their own needs, infrastructure provisioning, scaling, monitoring and maintinance are fully managed by the provider to simplify the experience.

The pricing model of standalone SaaS companies are also typically subscribtion based, varying with factors like usage volume, quary compexity and added features.

**Cloud Providers**

The main feature you can get with a cloud provider is the seamless integration with their cloud ecosystem, making it easy for users to access other services like storage and compute.

In addition to search functionality, they will offer a comprehensive data and analytics platform, with services such as data ingestion, processing, analytics and visualization.

Another advantage with using a cloud provider is the possibilities for scaling. Here you have a larger infrastructure to leverage, making it easy to scale up or down with demand, without the need to worry about infrastructure management.

This goes hand in hand with the pricing model, which is typically pay-as-you-go, where you only pay for what you are using. This can make for a more flexible and cost-effective model.

**What is best?**

As described, there are several pros and cons with both solutions. As I see it, if you want the most efficient search system provider, you would go with the specialized standalone companies. But if you just want a working system on your site, and are already using a cloud provider for storage, then the simple answer would be your cloud provider. All in all, as with most development platforms, it depends on your needs, which should most likely be covered by one or more platform solution. For the sake of this case study, we eill continue exploring the standalone market, comparing some of Algolias biggest competitors.
