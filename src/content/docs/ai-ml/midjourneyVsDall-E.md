## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks such as learning from experience, understanding language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. The overall goal is to create machines and software that mimic human-like cognitive functions. Among the diverse array of AI tools available, notable mentions include ChatGPT, Midjourney, and DALL·E.

This case study is dedicated to exploring two AI image generators, Midjourney and DALL·E, both capable at crafting images in response to human prompts. This case study will dive into a brief introduction for them both, main features and also compare some of their features. This case study aims to provide insights into the capabilities and nuances of these two AI tools, and into their roles in shaping the ever-changing landscape of artificial intelligence


## Midjourney and DALL·E: A Brief Overview

### Midjourney

Launched in 2022 by David Holz, a former NASA researcher and co-founder of Leap Motion, Midjourney has rapidly become one of the most widely used AI image generators. Accessible through Discord, it empowers users to craft visually stunning images by providing text prompts. Operating seamlessly within Discord, Midjourney eliminates the need for specialized hardware or software, although subscription to one of the four plans is necessary to unleash its image-generating capabilities.

To begin using Midjourney:

- Sign up/log in to your Discord account.
- Subscribe to a Midjourney Plan (subscription overview available [here](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/plans)).
- Join the Midjourney server on Discord.
- Initiate image generation with your prompt.

### DALL·E

Within OpenAI's creative AI toolkit, DALL·E was launched in 2021 and stands out alongside ChatGPT and Sora. While ChatGPT responds with text and Sora generates videos, DALL·E specializes in creating images. Accessible through a web browser, DALL·E reaches its full potential with a subscription to either the Plus, Team or Enterprise plan. What distinguishes it is the seamless integration with ChatGPT, allowing users to effortlessly switch between text and image generation within the same chat environment.

As of February 2024, the latest iteration of the AI tool is DALL·E 3. Described by the creators, <i>"DALL·E 3 understands significantly more nuance and detail than our previous systems, allowing you to effortlessly translate your ideas into exceptionally accurate images."</i>

Contrasted with its forerunner DALL·E 2, the newer version DALL·E 3, places a heightened emphasis on individual words within user prompts. This strategic shift results in improved outcomes, showcasing the tool's commitment to refining the image generation process by considering each element of the input with greater precision and nuance than before. 

To begin using DALL·E:

- Sign up/log in to your OpenAI account at [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
- Upgrade your subscription to either Plus, Team or Enterprise.
- Initiate image generation with your prompt.
