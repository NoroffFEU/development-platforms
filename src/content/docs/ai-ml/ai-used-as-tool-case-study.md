# AI used as a tool

## Brief history

 - 1940: the concept for ML/AI was in the mind of researchers.
 - 1950: Early developments in the field of ML, which involved a combination of philosophy, mathematics and engineering.
 - 1960: Generative AI was introduced in chatbots.
 - 2000: Jerome Friedman's work created a more complex ML model, by comparing the results predicted by an algorithm to the actual results using this method an algrorithm could be trained to make more accurate predictions the next time.
 - 2014: AI being able to create convincingly real images, vidoes and audio of real people.
 - 2022: ChatGPT sees first light as it launched on november 30th 2022. chatGPT enables the users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired lenght, format, style, level of detail and language.

## Articial intelligence and its uses

In this age, using AI to help create codes snippets is becoming more normal as they become more capable.
with the creation of AI's like chatGPT and others we can see a drastic change in how many approach the creating of apps or web sites.
There is an endless amount of possibilites from already established programmers to people just learning about it using AI to help them create apps.

but an important part of this is not to only rely on the AI knowing how to make a fully finished project, humans still need to check over and control what has been made and implement it correctly. another aspect is that AI is meant to supplement our creation, and not replace us int it, the use of AI as a tool is meant to speed up the writing process of coding/programming. an underlying issue that might occur with the use of AI is that it will be the sole writer of a project without much control by a human, this is where a beginner might fall and assume that the AI knows and is able to write perfect code.

some of the uses we can get with AI is

 - Create functions
 - Create arrays
 - Create comments on code
 - Create code snippets
 - Solve easy tasks
 - Troubleshoot
 - Solve errors

## AI used as a tool

When using working on a project, and you run into an error or a problem thats hard to solve. this is when using AI might be of a big help to you. you can either prompt what see into an IA like chatGPT or have a built-in AI help you figure out what the issue is, this is where we see the most use of AI as a tool. you can also take advantage of AI for when you're writing easy code snippets or a function you'll reuse. you can have it write the array or other functions that is often used.

AI can also be used to learn about the product as an end-user, testing things a human wouldn't in end-to-end testing, it might be able to find bugs that would otherwise be overlooked. combing AI's predicability with a humans more chaotic behaviour could lead more bugs and errors being uncovered than relying only on humans or only AI. It can also be used for stress testing the app or web site, to see how it handles a large number of users interacting with said project.

With all these new designer and art AI, you can also use this to your advantage when coming up with new design ideas by creating prototypes and mockups using prompts for your app or website. it can create many diffrent looks that you then can show to get input on, this being either from the product owner or an end user. in the same spirit the AI can also make placeholder designs and text, so you dont have to keep using Lorem Ipsum for everything. popular examples for designer/art AI's are DALLE-2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion

Another great use for AI, where it could be used to help users as in a chat function. you can use AI to solve most of the easy stuff, and then forward the users to an actual human if it encounters something its unable to solve. this way you dont have to swamp the human helpdesk with easy to solve problems, and the helpdesk will have more time to do other work or solve the problem the AI was not able to solve on its own.

## Misuse of AI

With how common and widespread AI is becoming, it is important to not misuse the powers you wield with it. a common factor where AI is in the danger of misuse, is the data it has been trained with, its decision making might be biased, the information can be outdated or an employer might look to replace their workers relying only on AI among other things.
Another big concern with the use of AI is security risks, lack of transparency, privacy and probably the biggest of them all dependence on AI itself.

Another big risk is the use of AI in hacking, where the AI will teach itself how to bruteforce passwords or in conjunction with other programs hack into someones user account from anything such as reddit, facebook and others. 

Dangers of misuse with AI

 - Privacy concerns
 - Ethical dilemmas
 - Dependence on AI
 - Lack of Transparency
 - Bias and discrimination
 - Security risks
