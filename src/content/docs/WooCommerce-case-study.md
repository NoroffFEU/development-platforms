# Introduction 

The e-commerce market has seen significant growth in recent years. In 2022, the total revenue for the retail e-commerce market was $5.3 trillion, and it is expected to exceed $7 trillion by 2027.

With this rise, the market now offers many options for creating your own e-commerce store. There are platforms that are very beginner-friendly, while others require development expertise.

In this article, I will discuss WooCommerce as an online store option in the e-commerce market. I will cover its history, main features, market comparison, how to get started with WooCommerce, and my conclusion.

## History 

- **2011** – WooCommerce launched
- **2014** – First conference that focuses only on Ecommerce using WooCommerce
- **2015** – WooCommerce were acquired by Automattic (operator of Wordpress.com and core contributor to the WordPress software).
- **2020** – 3.9 Million websites using WooCommerce
  - Mobile app was available (stores owners view and manage their stores from mobile devices)
  - Acquired MailPoet (a popular WordPress newsletter)

## Main Features 

- **SEO** – WooCommerce lets the user set up permalinks as they like and by using the woo market store you get access to really good SEO plugins.
- **Website Builders** - WordPress has a website builder with drag and drop functionality called Gutenberg, that makes it easy to make ecommerce stores. Another popular option is a website builder plugin called Elementor.
- **Payment and shipping** – it is easy to set up a payment solution and a shipping solution on your website.
- **Developer community** - 34% of the web is run on WordPress, so the developer community is the heart and soul of the software.
- **Scalability** – you can start as a small ecommerce store and grow to a big firm only using WooCommerce as your ecommerce solution.

However, WooCommerce have some limitations compared to other ecommerce platform:

- **Developer Knowledge** – unless you are using a website builder it will be hard to get the website to look exactly as you like. Even when using a website builder, it is a process to learn.
- **Pay for plugins** – If you want some functionality on your website, as for example bundle buyer, you must pay to get this function.
- **Buy Domain and Hosting** – When using WooCommerce, you must buy your own domain and hosting. Shopify for example is hosting included.

## Compare with other companies 

The biggest competitor for WooCommerce is Shopify. Other competitors are Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, Bigcommerce. To keep this article to not become too large we will only focus on WooCommerce vs Shopify.

## WooCommerce vs Shopify

| Free | |

## Conclusion 

For beginners who want an easy start and have no development skills, I would recommend Shopify. Shopify is user-friendly and requires no programming skills to create and manage an online store, making it ideal for those new to e-commerce.

However, if you are looking for more control, customization, and better SEO options, WooCommerce is the way to go. WooCommerce allows for a higher degree of flexibility and scalability, making it the best choice for those who are serious about building a robust and customized online store.

In conclusion, Shopify is perfect for beginners due to its simplicity and ease of use, but WooCommerce is the superior option for those who want to take their e-commerce site to the next level.
