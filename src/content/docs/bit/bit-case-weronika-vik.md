## Main Features

Bit is a platform designed to streamline the development, sharing and management of UI components, addressing common challanges in modern frontend development. Below is an overview of it's primary features and their benefits:

- **Component Sharing:** Bit allows developers to extract individual components from their projects and share them across teams or applications. This helps reduce duplication and ensures consistency across codebases.
- **Version Control for Components:** Each component managed by Bit is version-controlled, enabling developers to track changes, roll back to earlier version and maintan a stable development environment.
- **Framework Compatibility:** Bit supports multiple frameworks such as React, Vue and Angular, making it a versatile tool for teams with diverse technologies.
- **Component Testing and Previewing:** Bit offers a visual workspace for testing and previewing components before integrating them into projects. Developers can see how components behave in isolation or with mock data.
- **Collaboration-Friendly:** Bit fosters collaboration by creating a shared hub for components, enabling teams to work together more efficiently, especially in distributed setups.
- **Dependency Management::** Bit handles component dependencies automatically, ensuring that each piece of the project is functional and up to date without manual intervention.
- **Consistansy:** Bit is widely used to manage design systems, helping organications to maintain consistent branding and UI across large scale projetcs.

## Market Comparison

In the evolving landscape of software development, tools and platforms that streamline workflows and enchance collaboration have become essential. With the rise of component driven development, plenty of developers seek ways to efficiently manage and reuse UI components across projects. Bit is one such platform, offering solutions for component sharing, versioning and collaboration.
However, Bit is not the only tool on the market with such qualities, the top competitors with similar features are Storybook, Lerna and npm. Several other platforms offer similar functionalities, each with it's strenght and weaknesses. By evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of these platforms, I aim to provide a clearer picture of how Bit stands in a relation to it's competitors, and where it excels and/or falls short.

- **Bit vs Storybook:** While Bit and Storybook operate within the component-driven development ecosystem, they serve distinct purposes and are not direct competeitors. Bit is primarily focused on enabling developers to share and collaborate on reusable components across different projects, while Storybook serves as a development environment for building and testing UI components in isolation within a single project.
One key difference between the two is their focus on integration. Bit supports a wide range of frameworks, such as React, Vue and Angular, allowing developers to use it across various technologies and projects. This makes it a versatile solutoin for teams working with different tech stacks. in contrast, Storybook is more specialized, initially focused on React, though it has expanded to support other frameworks. It's core strength lies in providing a platform for developers to build and visually test UI components in isolation, making it an excellent tool for dovumenting and showcasing individual components within a project.
When it comes to collaboration, Bit has a clear advantage, it enables teams to share components across projects, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy. The platform's version control system allows developers to track changes to individual components and roll back if necessary, making it ideal for large teams working on multiple applications. On the other hand, Storybook excels in helping developers design, build and test components in isolation but does not offer the same level of cross-project sharing or version control. It is more geared towards creating comprehensive components libraries and documenting them for other developers to reference.
In summary, Bit and Storybook serve different needs within the development process. Bit is better suited for teams that need to manage and collaborate on reusable components across multiple projects, while Storybook shines when it comes to building and documenting components in a single codebase- Both tools enchance the component-driven development workflow, but they cater to different aspects aspects of the process.

- **Bit vs Lerna:** Bit and Lerna are both tools that aim to streamline development processes, but they target different areas of the workflow. Lerna is designed primarily for managing monorepros - repositories that contain multiple packages. It simplifies tasks such as dependency amanagement and versioning within a single repository. Lerna helps teams working with a monorepo structure to manage their projects more effectively by handling inter-package dependenvies and potimizing the publishing process for multiple pakcages at once.
Bit is more focused on managing individual UI components and enabling their reuse across multiple projects. It allows developers to isolate components from their codebases and share them with other teams or applications, making it easier to maintain consistency and reduce duplication. Unlike Lerna, whihc is mostly used for managing code within a single monorepo, Bit operates across different repositories, making it a more versatile tool for teams working with multiple projects or in distributed environments.
While Lerna excels at handling multiple packages within one codebase as previously mentioned, Bit offers more granular control over the reuse of specific components, which can be shared and versioned independently across different projects. This makes Bit particulary valuable for teams working on projects where modularity and component sharing are essential. However, Lerna may still be the preferred option for teams using monorepo and needing to manage entire packages rather than individual components.
In conclusion, Lerna is ideal for monorepos where managing multiple pakcages and dependencies is a priority, while Bit is better suited for teams looking to share and collaborate on reusable components across different projects.

- **Bit vs npm:** Bit and npm (Node Package Manager) are both tools used in the development process, but they serve fundamentally different purposes. npm is primarily a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js projects. It allows developers to manage install dependencies from a large registry of pakcages. Developers can use npm to download libraries and tools that they need to build their apllications and it also provides a way to publish their own packages for others to use.
In contrast, Bit is a platform that focuses on the management and sharing of indicidual UI components. While npm manages entire pakcages, which are often composed of many different modules of features, Bit allows developers to break down their projects into smaller, reusable components. These components can be shared across different applications, versioned and updated independently, helping to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy.
One major difference between the two is that npm is a general-puprose package manager, widely used for handling dependencies in JavaScript and Node.js projects, where as Bit is a specialized tool that facilitates the sharing and collaboration of indicidual components, especially in component driven development workflows. Bit add a layer of functionality on top of package management by offering features like version control for components, real-time updates and a visual workspace for testing components.
While npm has a much larger community and a wider range of packages, Bit provides a more targeted solution for teams that need to collaborate on reusable components across different projects. For developers looking to share small, specific pieces of UI code rather than entire packages, Bit offers a more granular and flexible apporach.
In Summary, npm is an essential tool for managing JavaScript dependencies, while Bit excels in the sharing and versioning of individual components across multiple projects. Developers who need to manage entire packages would benefit from npm, but for teams focused on component reuse and collaboration, Bit offers more specialized features.

## Getting Started

I will be showing how to set up and use Bit within a project using VS Code as the code editor and Bash for terminal commands. I will be using the Bit Getting started guide on how to install and initialize the project.

OBS! Make sure you make an account before starting, only registered users can use Bit (as far as I am aware).

### Creating a Component 

1. Make a new repro where your will be testing and creating your components using Bit.
2. Install Bit by using the command "npx @teambit/bvm install" in the terminal of your computer.
3. To initalize a workspace use the command "bit init --default-scope my-org.my-project" in the terminal, replace the my-org with your organization name and my-project with your projects name, either a already existing project or a new one. 
4. Make a new folder inside the repro where you wish your component to be inside, I made a folder named button and added a button.html, button.css and button.js files with basic codes inside.
5. To add your component to Bit use the command: "bit add your-component.js your-component.css your-component.html --main your-component.js". Since I named everything "button" for me it looks like such: "bit add button.js button.css button.html --main button.js
". 
6. Now that the component is successfully added to Bit, we will need to tag it to give it a version number so we can later fetch and update the component. using the command "bit tag --build" Bit should do everything by itself.
7. Before we can export the component, we must be logged in, to make sure you are logged in use the command "bit login". If you are not logged in, you will be transfered to a new webpage where you must login to your Bit account.
8. Once the component is tagged, and we are logged in to our Bit account, we can export it to the Bit platform so that it is available to be used in other projects or teams. Use the command: "bit export" in the terminal to push the component. To check if you have successfully exported your component, open up the webpage with you Bit account and under "overview" you can see if you have gotten a new/existing repro and a new component inside it.

### Fetching a Component

1. To start fetching yours or others components, you must first see if they exist. In your Bit account, navigate where the component you wish to fetch is, if we continue where we left off, the component will be inside the repro you have made earlier, under "overview". You should see the component listed there with the version 1.0.0 as it was the first component we made and have not added any "updates" to it. You can also see all the details to it by clicking the component to ensure everything is correct.
2. To confirm that our component has been exported and can be used in other projects, we can import it into a different project, or even the same project we used earlier. Open up the terminal and navigate into your new/previous repro. Import the component by running the command "bit import your-org.your-repro-name.component". Replace your-org with your organization name, repro-name with your previously made repro's name where the component is inside, and component with the component's name.
3. If it everything goes successfully, the component should now be inside your new repro, or "reused" in your old repro. To test if it works you can run the command "bit start" or use live-server.
