## Introduction

This case study begins with a general overview of WAF technology, providing insight into its purpose and importance in modern web security. It then focuses on two widely-used tools: Cloudflare WAF and AWS WAF, exploring their key features, integrations, and use cases. Additionally, the study includes a market comparison with other tools, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

**But what is WAF?** A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is like a smart security guard for your website. It monitors all incoming traffic, blocks harmful activities like hacking attempts, and keeps your site safe and running smoothly. WAFs are essential for protecting against common web attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and DDoS.

**Usefulness to Developers**

- **Time-Saving:** Automates security, freeing developers to focus on coding.
- **Integration-Friendly:** Easily incorporates into CI/CD workflows.
- **Improved App Stability:** Blocks threats that could disrupt application functionality.

## Brief History

- **1990s:** Firewalls emerged to protect networks, focusing on packet filtering; web apps introduced new vulnerabilities.This case study begins with a general overview of WAF technology, providing insight into its purpose and importance in modern web security. It then focuses on two widely-used tools: Cloudflare WAF and AWS WAF, exploring their key features, integrations, and use cases. Additionally, the study includes a market comparison with other tools, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.
