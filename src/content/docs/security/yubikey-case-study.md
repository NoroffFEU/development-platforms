## Introduction

Yubico's YubiKey is a hardware-based authentication solution that has revolutionized secure access to digital systems. As cyber-attacks become more sophisticated, traditional password-based authentication is increasingly vulnerable. YubiKey provides strong two-factor and multi-factor authentication (2FA/MFA) using physical keys to prevent phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized access.
