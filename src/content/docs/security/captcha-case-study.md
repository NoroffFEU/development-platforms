## Introduction

CAPTCHA is an abbreviation for “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart”[1]. CAPTCHA is used to filter out bots from real users when accessing websites on the internet [1]. This case study will look into a brief history of CAPTCHA, applications of CAPTCHA, its strengths and weaknesses, and similar existing technologies and how it compares.

## Brief History

Luis von Ahn, David Abraham, Manuel Blum, Michael Crawford, Ben Maurer, Colin McMillen, and Edison Tan at Carnegie Mellon University created CAPTCHA in the year 2000 [2]. CAPTCHA was created because people were signing up to websites with bots to create millions of accounts and CAPTCHA was supposed to prevent that. The initial success of CAPTCHA was excellent with 97% success rate of identifying bots and human [2] Over time it has become an arms race between botters and bot prevention teams [2]. Captcha has also been further developed into reCAPTCHA by many of the same authors and google [2]. This case study looks into CAPTCHA only.
