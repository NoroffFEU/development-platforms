## Introduction

"GPT" is short for for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer"
In terms of language models, ChatGPT is a sizable one. It was trained to anticipate the subsequent word that would be most likely to appear in a given sentence. The main distinction is that this chatbot's input is composed of billions of words drawn from a variety of sources.

ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI that is capable of generating human-like responses to a wide range of prompts. ChatGPT is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, which uses unsupervised learning to generate text that is similar to human writing.
In short, it is an artificial intelligence-powered natural language processing tool. To name a few things you can do with it: it assist with things like writing lyrics for songs, translating words between languages, making workout plans and write code in a several computer languages.

## Brief History

ChatGPT is part of a family of models developed by OpenAI that use the GPT architecture. The original GPT model was released in 2018, and was trained on a large corpus of text data from the internet. Since then, OpenAI has released several new versions of the GPT model, with each iteration improving the quality of the generated text.
The history of ChatGPT is short. There is however some earlier events that provide an understanding of the background.

Alan Turing, a pioneering British computer scientist, publishes "Computing Machines and Intelligence» in the 1950’s. In which he makes the argument that a machine is intelligent if it can persuade a person that they are speaking to another human. He the proceeds to create the Turing Test.

In 1983, William Chamberlain and Thomas Etter develop RACTER, a chatbot whose goal is to amuse users.

The year 2000 saw the development of ALICE (Artificial Language Internet Computer Entity). Even though it failed the Turing Test, it served as the model for the majority of modern chat bots.

Apple introduces Siri in 2010.

Launch of Alexa by Amazon in 2016.

The paper "Improving English Comprehension by Generative Pre-Training," published by OpenAI on June 11th 2018, a paper presenting the differences between NLP and GPT.

OpenAI releases GPT-2 in November 2019 as a "direct scale-up" of GPT.

GPT-3 is released for beta testing in July 2020.

Released in 2021, GitHub Copilot was created in partnership with OpenAI and is based on GPT-3.

The company's most sophisticated AI chatbot to date, Blenderbot 3, is released by Meta in 2022.

Launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2022, based on the GPT-3.5 model.

## Features

It can solve mathematical problems, explain complicated concepts in simple words, and fix grammar, making it a useful tool for students who need help with their assignments or just want to cheat on their schoolwork. It may be used to compose lyrics, jokes, novels etc. Some have also used it for schoolwork and scientific papers. The material may not be accurate, but the text bot does an good job of imitating academic language.

It can converse with people in a conversational manner since it has the capacity to remember prior queries posed in a chat.

When I look at Chat GPT as a developer, I try to see its potensial to help me with code, and some creative guidance. Its capability to generate code snippets in a variety of programming languages is one of the most important aspects for web and software development.

## How it works

ChatGPT uses a deep neural network architecture called a Transformer, which was introduced in 2017. Transformers are designed to process sequential data, such as text, and are particularly well-suited to generating text that is coherent and grammatically correct.
ChatGPT is trained using a large amount of text data, which allows it to learn the statistical patterns and relationships that exist within human language. When a user inputs a prompt, ChatGPT uses this knowledge to generate a response that is relevant.

## Strengths

ChatGPT is available to everyone. There are other other languages supported, so it is not just for English speakers. It can help people with day-to-day things as well as being a useful tool for work.

The bot can assist with a variety of programming languages in addition to hosting services, content management systems, databases, and git, to name a few. This characteristic makes the bot perfect for interview preparation as well. You can even ask it to conduct the interview; it will present you with a list of questions, and if you offer incomplete answers, it will complete them for you.

ChatGPT can be fine-tuned on specific tasks and datasets to improve its performance for particular use cases. This means that organizations can train ChatGPT to specialize in certain types of writing, such as legal or medical writing, or to incorporate domain-specific language and terminology.

It has helped me with becoming a more effective student. Reducing the time I spend preparing or reading instructions, the tool, when utilized properly, can make us more productive. For students or developers who are just starting out in their jobs, it is very helpful.

## Weaknesses

It has capacity restrictions for the servers. Due to the number of users attempting to use the service at the same time, it is occasionally unavailable.

Even thou the training was extensive, it was completed in 2021, therefore it was of little value for learning about continually changing subjects. It is restricted to the data used during its training, therefore it is unable to conduct internet searches to locate new sources of information.

It is not reliable when you ask the same question repeatedly and in various ways. You may get different answers.
The facts are not always facts. The «wrong facts» it delivers from time to time are written in such a way that it looks convincing. Users should double check the answers by visiting dependable sources.

## Comparison

ChatGPT is one of several NLP models that are capable of generating human-like text. Some of the other models that are commonly used for this purpose include Google's Meena, Microsoft's XiaoIce, and Facebook's Blender.
Compared to these models, ChatGPT is generally considered to be more versatile and capable of generating text in a wider range of styles and genres. However, it also tends to generate more irrelevant or nonsensical responses than some of the other models.

## Summary

ChatGPT can be pretty useful for web developers who want quick answers to coding questions or need clarification on certain concepts. It's got a ton of knowledge on programming languages, frameworks, and tools, so it can be a helpful resource for developers who are exploring new areas of development. However, it's not always accurate and its responses might not be relevant to the specific question asked, which could lead to confusion or misinformation. Plus, it can't replicate the collaborative problem-solving that happens between human developers, which can be a great learning experience for new developers.

I used more youtube videos then this and googled alot.
