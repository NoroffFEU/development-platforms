## Introduction  
OpenResty is a high-performance web platform that embeds the Lua scripting language into **Nginx**, enabling developers to build dynamic web applications, APIs, and gateways. By combining Nginx’s speed with Lua’s flexibility, OpenResty solves problems like real-time request processing, edge computing, and scalable API management. Its unique integration of Lua scripting directly into Nginx makes it a standout tool for low-latency, high-concurrency use cases.

## Brief History  
- **2007**: Created by **Yichun Zhang** (agentzh) to address scalability issues at Taobao (Alibaba’s e-commerce platform).  
- **2011**: Open-sourced, gaining adoption for its lightweight scripting capabilities.  
- **2015**: Adopted by **Cloudflare** for edge security tools like Web Application Firewalls (WAF).  
- **2017**: Became the foundation for **Kong API Gateway**, a widely-used open-source API management tool.  
- **Today**: OpenResty powers critical infrastructure for fintech, e-commerce, and CDN providers, with a thriving community of contributors.

## Main Features  

| Feature               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lua Scripting**     | Embed Lua code directly into Nginx for dynamic routing, authentication, and request/response manipulation. |
| **High Performance**  | Leverages Nginx’s event-driven architecture and LuaJIT for sub-millisecond latency. |
| **Extensibility**     | Integrates with Redis, MySQL, Kafka, and more via pre-built Lua modules (e.g., `lua-resty-redis`). |
| **Scalability**       | Handles 10,000+ concurrent connections with minimal CPU/memory usage.       |
