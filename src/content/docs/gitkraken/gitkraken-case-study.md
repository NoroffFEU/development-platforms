## **Introduction to** ![](https://www.gitkraken.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Group-771.svg)

GitKraken is a multiplaform and GUI (graphical user interface) for Git as an alternative to the command line with a variety of actions and features. In this case study we will go through its history, main features, pros and cons and how to get started with it.

## **Main Features**

### **View of the Commit History**

![GitKraken history of commits screenshot from GitKraken official website](https://www.gitkraken.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1-visual-commit-graph-1600x900-1-1024x576.png.webp)

The commit graph will show a clear visualization of the branch structure and commit history as seen above.

The developer is able to view their recent Git actions on the repo while also shows what teammate made which code changes - making bug identification much easier to track down and possibly revert back to a previous version bug free.

From a team point of view working in bigger projects, this kind of clean organized overview is essencial for examination of the team's merge history.

### **Resolve Merge Conflicts**

GitKraken Client has a built-in Merge Tool to make conflict resolution easier and safer. A developer is able to see the current branch and the target branch that they’re merging into side by side. By simply selecting a section, it will be added to the output so you can decide what changes to commit.

### **Interactive Rebases**

![screenshot of an interactive rebase between conflicting branches using GitKraken from GitKraken official website](https://www.gitkraken.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/6-interactive-rebase-1600x900-1.png.webp)

Rebasing in GitKraken is easy as the developer is able to make use of an interactive rebase without worrying about syntax or order but instead by simply draging and droping a branch which will give complete control to Pick, Reword, Squash, and Drop commits.

### **Git Integrations**

GitKraken has integrations with **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Azure DevOps**, **Trello** and **Bitbucket** creating a smooth and efficient workflow by generating SSH keys, clone, fork, add remotes, create PRs and more - all this while never needing to leave the platform.

### **Create & Manage Pull Requests**

![screenshot of a PR from GitKraken official website](https://www.gitkraken.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5-PR-view-1600x900-1-1024x576.png.webp)

GitKraken Client is connected to most of the Git repository hosting services. Through GitKraken Client it’s possible to create PRs, especially if a developer is using the **GitHub integration** which gives even more PR capabilities like edit, merge, approve, request changes or comment on a PR.

### **Terminal Experience amplified**

![screenshot of the overview of GitKraken built-in terminal from GitKraken official website](https://www.gitkraken.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2-gk-cli-1600x900-1-1024x576.png.webp)

GitKraken’s visual Git commit graph gives the developer a terminal experience with the option to live overview the commit history and branches side by side for a clear and easy perspective on their work.

### **Repository Arrangement**

![screenshot of a repo list from GitKraken official website](https://www.gitkraken.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Local-Workpace-Example2.png.webp)

With Local Workspaces a developer is able to sort out his repositories even if they're from different hosts and with Cloud Workspaces it's possible to organize all issues, branches, PRs and more.

## **More great features**:

| Feature              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Built-in code editor | In addition to all previous features, it is also possible to create new code without leaving the app.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Syntax Highlighting  | For a clear and more organized view of the code, the syntax has built-in highlighting with bright colours making every commit color-coded along with the branch name, the user who committed to that branch, and a summary of those commits - making it especially useful to check up on another developer's code. |
| Tabs and submodules  | It is possible to separate your actions by tabs and submodules for a more organized workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Keyboard shortcuts   | Shortcuts are optional for a faster coding experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| File mini map        | Overview of all the files to better situate when working in extensive projects, especially in team projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Learning area        | Not only a great tool for experienced developers but also for students and junior developers - as it has a Learning area with Commands, Tutorials and more - showing great concern for newcomers to fully understand the process of using Git for code development.                                                |
| Dark and Light mode  | It's possible to use GitKraken on light or dark mode, depending on user preference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
