## Introduction

Web scraping encompasses various techniques for extracting data from websites, often automated through bots or web crawlers. It involves gathering information from web pages and transforming it into a more useful format. Initially employed for indexing web content by search engines, it has found diverse applications in market research, competitive intelligence, and AI training.

## Brief History

- 1993: The first web robot, the World Wide Web Wanderer, emerged, primarily for measuring internet size.
- 1994 to 2000: Search engine giants like Google and Yahoo developed efficient web scraping methods for web page indexing.
- 2020: Web scraping gained traction in machine learning and AI training.

## Understanding Web Scraping

Web Scraping is the process of collecting data from a website. It involves using software programs or scripts to access web pages, retrieve the desired information, and then parse and extract the relevant data.One of the key distinctions of web scraping lies in its ability to delve beyond the surface content visible to users. Instead of merely copying what is displayed on the screen, web scrapers dig into the underlying HTML structure of web pages. This allows them to extract various types of data, including text, images, links, tables, and more, regardless of how they are formatted or presented on the site.

Moreover, advanced web scraping techniques encompass the rendering of entire websites, including dynamic elements such as JavaScript-generated content and CSS-styled layouts. By emulating the behavior of web browsers, modern web scrapers can interact with dynamic elements, ensuring comprehensive data extraction.
Unlike scraping which only copies pixels displayed on screen, web scraping extract underlying HTML code and send it to the user. More advanced web scrapers will render the entire site including CSS and Javascript elements.
Web scraping serves multiple purposes such as market research, competitive analysis, lead generation, and machine learning.

Some legal use cases includes:

- Search engine bots crawling a site, analysing its content and then ranking it.
- Price comparison sites deploying bots to auto-fetch prices and product descriptions for allied seller websites.
- Market research companies using scrapers to pull data from forums and social media (e.g., for sentiment analysis).
- AI training and data augmentation

There is hoverer a growing problem with malicious web scraping, that can be used to build fraudulent websites, steal competitive information og to create duplicate web sites for ad fraud purposes

Some illegal use cases includes:

- Plagiarism
- Fake eCommerce stores
- Fake Ads
- Price scraping

## Legality

The legality of web scraping varies globally, with some websites prohibiting it in their terms of service. However, it remains legal in several countries like Denmark and Norway.

## Web scraping with AI

Traditional web scraping methods used programming languages such as Python, NodeJs and C# to fetch and parse then desired data, but these methods often face challenges with evolving website designs and dynamic content. AI-powered solutions address these issues, offering resilience and efficiency in data extraction. AI tools automate data gathering, analysis, and processing, reducing user effort while enhancing accuracy. They find applications across social media, e-commerce, and various industries.

For example in a social media app like Facebook, AI tools can help with generate leads, plan advertising campaigns and analyse your competitors with the data it scraped.
In e-commerce you can use AI tools to scrape your competitors, and to find out what their are doing, how is their prices, learn som their success and apply their best practises to your website.

### Strengths of AI Tools

- **Improved Accuracy and Adaptive learning** AI Models can recognise when they`re not retrieving the correct data and recalibrate their approach accordingly.
- **Real-time Adaptation** With websites continually updating and changing their structures, AI tools can adapt in real time and ensuring the continuous flow of data.
- **Data Classification** AI Tools can classify the scraped data into predefined categories, adding structure to the raw data.
- **CAPTCHA Solving** Some AI Tools can recognise and tackle CAPTCHA challenges
- **User Behaviour Mimicking** AI can simulate human browsing behaviors aids in avoiding detection.
- **No-code / Low-code Platforms** Many AI Scraping tools require minimal coding, making web scraping accessible to a broader audience.

### Drawbacks of AI Tools

- **Length Limit** A common problem when using AI to scrape and process data is the query length limitation. the ChatGPT-3.5 for example has a limit of 4096 tokens per input.
- **AI can be wrong** AI's inability to think critically can lead to incorrect interpretations

### Example of AI tools for web scraping:

- **ChatGpt:** ChatGPT is free, and can create the script and analyse the data with the url provided by the user.
- **AIWebscraper Pro:** Utilizes AI algorithms for fast, accurate data extraction, real-time adaptation to changing website structures, and integration with various databases.
- **Browse AI:** Extract data from any website and turn it into a spreadsheet or an API with No-Code

## Getting Started

- Choose a target website
- Provide clear instructions to ChatGPT for writing a Python web scraper using BeautifulSoup.
- Give it Your URL as a target.
- Write the output. For example: "output : Save all the prices and titles for the games in a CSV file.
- Remember to give it additional instructions on handling character encoding and remove undesirable symbols in your CSV file.
- Install the BeautifulShop library, and request library, and run the generated code

## Conclusion

Web scraping with AI streamlines data gathering and analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. While AI tools offer automation and speed, human oversight remains crucial for mitigating potential errors. Collaboration between AI and human expertise ensures effective web scraping outcomes.
