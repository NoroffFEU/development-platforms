## Introduction

Web Scraping refers to different methods used for extracting data from a website. This information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful for the user. While web scraping can be done manually by software user, the term typically refers to a automated process implemented using a bot or a web crawler.
It is a form of copying which specified data is gathered and copied from the web, typically to a local database or a spreadsheet for analysis.
Web scraping became vastly used with the rise of search engines for indexing web pages and making the content searchable, its also used by of companies in the private sector for price comparison, industry statists and lead generation

In later years web scraping has become more popular in the artificial intelligence industry, where it can be used for AI training and data augmentation

## Brief History

- 1993: The first web robot called the World Wide Web Wanderer was created, which was intended to only measure the size of the internet
- 1994 to 2000: With the rise of search engines, companies like google and yahoo created efficient web scraping techniques to crawl and index web pages.
- 2020: Web scraping is used for machine learning, and AI Training

## What is web scraping

Web Scraping is the process of using software and bots to extract content and data from a website, It involves using software programs or scripts to access web pages, retrieve the desired information, and then parse and extract the relevant data. This data can include text, images, links, tables, and other types of content available on the web.
Unlike scraping which only copies pixels displayed on screen, web scraping extract underlying HTML code and send it to the user. More advanced web scrapers will render the entire site including CSS and Javascript elements.
Web scraping is used in a variety of businesses that rely on data harvesting.

Some legal use cases includes:

- Search engine bots crawling a site, analysing its content and then ranking it.
- Price comparison sites deploying bots to auto-fetch prices and product descriptions for allied seller websites.
- Market research companies using scrapers to pull data from forums and social media (e.g., for sentiment analysis).
- AI training and data augmentation

There is hoverer a growing problem with malicious web scraping, that can be used to build fraudulent websites, steal competitive information og to create duplicate web sites for ad fraud purposes

Some illegal use cases includes:

- Plagiarism
- Fake eCommerce stores
- Fake Ads
- Price scraping

## Legality

The legality of web scraping varies across the world. Web scraping may be against the terms of service of some websites. But web scraping itself is legal in several countries such as Denmark and Norway

## Web scraping tools

In order to gather data from sources such as websites you need to perform web scraping. Traditional web scraping methods used programming languages such as Python, NodeJs and C# to fetch and parse then needed data. But with the rise of more modern changing design and dynamic content of websites, traditional web scraper tools
often break. With the rises of AI, AI powered web scraping tools are created that can handle scraping continually changing websites, ensuring more resilient data extraction. AI tools can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of web scraping, and can create the software used for scraping, analyze and sort the data received from the web scraping process. AI have given people and businesses the tools to scrape vast amount of data without having or employing people with tec and programming skills.

Example of AI tools for web scraping:

- **ChatGpt:** ChatGPT is free, and can create the script and analyse the data with the url provided by the user.
- **AIWebscraper Pro:** Utilizes AI algorithms for fast, accurate data extraction, real-time adaptation to changing website structures, and integration with various databases.
- **Browse AI:** Extract data from any website and turn it into a spreadsheet or an API with No-Code

### Strengths of AI Tools

- **Improved Accuracy and Adaptive learning** AI Models can recognise when they`re not retrieving the correct data and recalibrate their approach accordingly.
- **Real-time Adaptation** WIth websites continually updating and changing their structures, AI tools can adapt in real time and ensuring the continuous flow of data.
- **Data Classification** AI Tools can classify the scraped data into predefined categories, adding structure to the raw data.
- **CAPTCHA Solving** Some AI Tools can recognise and solve CAPTCHAs, and common anti scraping measure.
- **User Behaviour Mimicking** AI can simulate human like browser behaviour, making it harder for websites to detect the scraping bot.
- **No-code / Low-code Platforms** Many AI Scraping tools require minimal coding, making web scraping accessible to a broader audience.

If you are writing about an open source tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar proprietary tools. Likewise, if you are writing about a proprietary tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar open source tools.

Similarly, a self hosted tool and a cloud based tool with a similar purpose may make for a good comparison.
