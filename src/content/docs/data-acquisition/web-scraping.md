## Introduction

Web Scraping refers to different methods used for extracting data from a website. This information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful for the user. While web scraping can be done manually by software user, the term typically refers to a automated process implemented using a bot or a web crawler.
It is a form of copying which specified data is gathered and copied from the web, typically to a local database or a spreadsheet for analysis.
Web scraping became vastly used with the rise of search engines for indexing web pages and making the content searchable, its also used by of companies in the private sector for price comparison, industry statists and lead generation

In later years web scraping has become more popular in the artificial intelligence industry, where it can be used for AI training and data augmentation

## Brief History

- 1993: The first web robot called the World Wide Web Wanderer was created, which was intended to only measure the size of the internet
- 1994 to 2000: With the rise of search engines, companies like google and yahoo created efficient web scraping techniques to crawl and index web pages.
- 2020: Web scraping is used for machine learning, and AI Training

## Features

In order to gather data from sources such as websites you need to perform web scraping. Traditional web scraping methods used programming languages such as Python, NodeJs and C# to fetch and parse then needed data. But with the rise of more modern changing design and dynamic content of websites, traditional web scraper tools
often break. With the rises of AI, AI powered scraping tools are created that can handle scraping continually changing websites, ensuring more resilient data extraction. AI tools can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of web scraping. AI tools can create the software used for scraping, analyze and sort the data received from the web scraping process. AI have given people and businesses the tools to scrape vast amount of data without having or employing people with tec and programming skills.

Example of AI tools for web scraping:

- **ChatGpt:** ChatGPT is free, and can create the script and analyse the data with the url provided by the user.
- **AIWebscraper Pro:** Utilizes AI algorithms for fast, accurate data extraction, real-time adaptation to changing website structures, and integration with various databases.
- **Browse AI:** Extract data from any website and turn it into a spreadsheet or an API with No-Code
