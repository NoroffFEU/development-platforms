## Introduction

Sanity CMS, developed by the Norwegian company Sanity.io, is a headless, fully customizable content management system designed to provide flexibility and control over content management. The development of Sanity CMS began in 2015 by co-founders Even Westvang, Simen Svale Skogsrud, and Magnus Holm. The team developed a website for renown Architect Rem Koolhaas. The site was an algorithmic website that would link to his Instagram account giving Rem live updates on how people were using his buildings. The team aimed to build a flexible, developer-friendly content management system that could serve a wide range of content-driven projects.

Sanity.io officially launched the Sanity CMS platform in 2017, introducing it as a headless CMS solution. Since then, Sanity has gained popularity among developers and content creators for its ease of use, flexibility, and powerful features.

Over the years, the Sanity team has continued to improve and expand the platform, adding new features, integrations, and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of its users. Sanity remains a prominent player in the headless CMS market, known for its developer-friendly approach and customizable nature.
