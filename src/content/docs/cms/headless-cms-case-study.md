## Introduction

Headless CMS is a content management system that separates the content of the web site or app from the front end. For frontend developers, and maybe in particular those working freelance, choosing what headless CMS to work with can be an important step in their career. Headless platforms allow front end developers to have full control over the design and functionality of the website, app etc., while still allowing the client to update and change content at will, most often through an easy to understand graphical interface. This study aims to highlight some of the most important features of headless CMS as a whole, as well as compare some of the most popular providers of headless CMS on the market today.

## Brief History

- 1997 - 2002: Organizations and companies made their own form of content management systems. THe late 90's also saw the emergence of the first enterprise CMSs. Examples include FileNet and StoryBuilder. GeoCities also operated in this time period, allowing users to host and manage their own websites.
- Mid 2000s: CMS providers we still know today started to appear, like Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla.
- Late 2000s: Smartphones and other digital media platforms demands more flexible adaptle content delivery. Deadless CMS grows out of this need.
- 2020s: Headless CMS continue to evolve, offering intergration with other tech, such as SEO, AI and ML.

## Main benefits, and some drawbacks, of using headless CMS

**Easily update and maintain content through a GUI for the client:**
Most providers of headless CMSs offer a graphical user interface for the client to use to update and maintain their content. This is an important reason for wanting to work with a headless CMS, as not all clients will be able to pay the developer to update the content for them after the web site or app is delivered to them. 

**Flexibility and control for the developer:** 
A headless CMS will order the content, but will not place any restrictions on the design of the web page, leaving the developer full control over his creation. The developer is free to use the tech stack they are most comfortable with, and will not have to worry that the user makes changes to their design without them knowing.

**Automatic patching and updating:** 
Most headless CMS platforms come with built in security, and the providers release updates and patches to address any security issues. The fact that the 

**Hosting and backend:** 
Many providers also offer hosting, making managing the website or app easier for the developer. Hosting makes it possible for the developer to deploy the website or application quickly, and they do not have to build their own backend.

On the other hand, using a headless CMS offers some drawbacks as well:

**Price:**
Although some providers are cheap, or even offer free tiers, the price can make a real jump if traffic is high and the needs changes and grows. 

**Insecure plugins:** 
Some providers provide plugins for different functionality, and being possibly made by anyone, some of these plugins can be insecure, stop functioning after an update etc. For the client, this can be detrimental to their ability to manage the content and the site all on their own.

**Overcomplicating:** 
If the site or app is relatively simple, using a headless CMS might make the job take longer than what is actually necessary.

## Market alternatives and their standout features

These are some of the most popular providers of headless CMS, as per winter 2024.

**Decap CMS:** 
Formerly known as Netlify CMS, Decap supports different Git platform APIs. It works with a host of static site generators, and offers authorization through Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket and JSON web tokens, providing a secure and convenient way to manage access to the CMS.

**Contentful:** 
Contentful is based on RESTful APIs. It has a customizable editor interface, secure previews with no danger of accidentally publishing unfinished content, all while it uses advanced caching to deliver content fast, improving performance.

**Sanity:** 
Sanity lets you manage different kinds of media with APIs, and Sanity Studio is an open-source CMS that connects to Sanityâ€™s datastore. It lets the user set up a customizable editing environment.

**Strapi:** 
Strapi is a free, open-source headless CMS that uses an API to link the frontend to the backend. It is considered easy to use, and can be used with React, TezJS, Vue, Nuxt.js, Next.js, Angular, Svelte, Sapper, and Flutter.

**Wordpress:** 
Wordpress is known to most, and has been around for a long time. It has the biggest share of the market, but is considered by many developers to be bloated and overdone, while others sing its praises for being beginner friendly. Headless Wordpress lets the client use the robust content management system of wordpress, while letting the developer use whatever stack they want for the frontend. Most wordpress tutorials are very beginner friendly, often worded in such a way as to be understandable to those with no knowledge of web development to begin with, even for their headless variant.

## Getting Started

Each of the providers of headless CMS have different ways of getting started. Some offer templates, and some are as simple as adding a couple of lines of code to your project. Based on what the target audience of the provider is, the tutorials for the platforms vary in complexity and wording. Several providers have their own youtube pages, some with comprehensive video tutorials, but reading the documentation for each service is essential. 

## Conclusion

Headless CMS is all the rage these days, underlined by the number of providers that exist. The question, it seems, is not if one should use a headless CMS, but which one. The market is rife with alternatives, some very similar to each other, and some not so much, some with a great share of the market after dominating for several years, and some seemingly trying to reinvent the wheel. If anything, the width and breadth of headless CMS providers out there, only proves that every developer has different needs and wants both in regards to both their own and their clients' preferences. And choosing a provider seems to be just about that - preference - as there is no agreement on which is "the best".
