## Introduction:

Ghost CMS is a popular content management system specifically designed for bloggers.
It's an open-source CMS, and in this study-case, we'll explore it's history, main features and how to get started with Ghost.

## Brief history:

Ghost was created in 2013 by John O'Nolan, a former Deputy Head of the WordPress user interface team.
O'Nolan was frustrated with the complexity and bloating of existing blogging platforms and he wanted to create a modern and minimalist CMS that would put
the focus on creating content.

O'Nolan launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development of Ghost, and the campaign raised over £196,000.
The first version of Ghost was released in September of 2013.
Ghost was praised by the users for its simplicity, speed, and ease of use, and it quickly established itself as a popular alternative to more complex and bloated CMS platforms.

Over the years, Ghost has continued to evolve and improve. The Ghost team has added new features and functionality, and they have worked hard to make Ghost more
accessible to a wider range of users. Today, Ghost is used by thousands of bloggers and content creators around the world, and it remains one of the most popular
and highly regarded CMS platforms in the industry.

find plugins, themes and previously asked questions with Ghost. WordPress also offers more features and customization than Ghost, but at the cost of a more complex interface.
