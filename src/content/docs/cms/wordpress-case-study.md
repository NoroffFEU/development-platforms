## Main Features

The open-source content management system, WordPress, is at its core, a tool that makes it easy for developers and non-developers to make and manage important aspects of websites (e.g. content) without knowing much or anything about programming. This means that building a website can be accessible to anyone, even people who aren’t developers.

7 good reasons to use WordPress:

**1. Free and open-source software**

WordPress is free for anyone to download. And being an open-source software means that WodPress is developed by a collection of contributers, but fear not, you don’t have to contribute by e.g. being a beta tester or a brand advocate if you don’t want to. 

**Note** that even though the software is free, you will most likely end up spending a little bit of money. WordPress is self-hosted so you will need hosting services.

**2. It’s adaptable**

When WordPress first was released it was originally created as a tool to publish blogs, but with the variaty of new releases over the years the platform has changed. Now, with the adaptions made to the software you can easily make pretty much anything you can think of with WordPress. 

Here are a few examples:
- Blogs
- eCommerce sites
- Business sites
- Chatrooms
- Non-profit websites (i.e. for collecting donations)
- Portfolios
- Job boards
- Forums

With WordPress you can easily make forums and eCommerce sites that function with simple plugins and themes.

**Note:** Some plugins and themes require a small one-time fee.

**3. Supports various media types**

If you want to put a photo, gif, video or document on your website, WordPress supports most file types. 

**Note:** Make sure to follow the rules and use legally media that is either owned by you, open for free download or usable when credits are given (this goes for all websites, not just WordPress).

**4. Easy to Learn**

The WordPress software is easy to use, anoyone could start playing around with the dashboard and then ten minutes in you’d have an understanding of the interface. There‘s also tons of blogs, forums, online courses, seminars, webinars, books etc. outlining the different aspects of the platform.  

**5. Easy to manage**

Website management typically involves: 

- Making sure the server is okay.
- Keeping checks on security.
- Running backups.
- Updating plugins, themes, and the WordPress software.
- Managing spam.
- Testing for functionality and broken links.
- Making improvements in speed and SEO.

You don’t personally check on the server, so it’s more about having a good host and seeing if the site is running at all times. Security and WordPress site backups are either handled with plugins or through a managed WordPress hosting plan. SEO, backups, speed, security, broken links, and spam can be managed using plugins. So apart from that, the only manual maintenance tasks you have to do is update plugins, themes, and WordPress itself. WordPress notifies you when updates are released and then you can make the updates whenever you see the warnings. It usually takes less than a minute for any updates.

**6. Full ownership of the site**

WordPress gives users full control over their website, everything from content and design to functionality. There’s also no restrictions on monetizing your site, so you can display ads, become an affiliate, sell products or services etc.

**7. Multilingual**

WordPress admin panel is available in over 70 languages, the software also has plenty of paid and free plugins for creating multilingual content.

## Getting Started

The first step is to buy a domain name and a hosting plan. A domain functions as your website’s address online, whereas web hosting is responsible for storing your website files.

On [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/) users can install the software manually or a lot of hosting services have automatic installation. Create your WordPress login details and connect your custom domain to the site. Once everything is done you can log in to the WordPress dashboard and start building your website.

## Conclusion

WordPress is a powerful and popular software available for both developers and non-developers who want to be able to fully customize their website/platform and have complete control on every aspect of their project.
