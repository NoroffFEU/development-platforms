## Overview

**CircleCI** is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that automates the software development process, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure. It can integrate with GitHub, Bitbucket, and other version control systems to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This means developers can focus more on writing code and delivering value to users.

## History of CircleCI

**2011**: Founded by Paul Biggar and Allen Rohner to automate build, test, and deployment workflows.

**2014**: Gained traction globally; enhanced integrations with GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.

**2017**: Introduced CircleCI 2.0 with new configuration system, improved Docker support, and custom workflows.

**2018**: Formed strategic partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, Slack, and expanded ecosystem.

**2021-Present**: Launched CircleCI 3.0, focusing on performance, scalability, and developer experience.
