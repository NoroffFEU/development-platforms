## Overview

**CircleCI** is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that automates the software development process, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure. It can integrate with GitHub, Bitbucket, and other version control systems to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This means developers can focus on writing code and delivering value to users.

## History

### 2011-2013 - Early years

Founded in 2011 by Paul Biggar and Allen Rohner. They had plans to revolutionize the software development process by automating the build, test, and deployment workflows.
