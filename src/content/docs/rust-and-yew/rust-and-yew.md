## Introduction

In this case study, I explore the Rust programming language and the Yew framework. Rust is celebrated for its security, high performance, and memory safety, achieved without relying on garbage collection. Its advanced compiler acts as a code auditor, ensuring correctness and safety before execution.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate Rust's type system and unique features like PhantomData, while integrating a small frontend with Yew and an API using Sanity. I chose Sanity because it is free and quick to set up, allowing me to focus on Rust’s capabilities without needing a self-hosted backend.

Had I more time, I would have built a backend with Actix, but this would have required paid server resources. Nonetheless, this setup allowed me to stress-test Rust and observe its behavior and complexity in a full-stack context.

## Brief History

You may use a bullet point list or subheadings to structure a timeline of your chosen topic's history:
- 2010: Rust is started by Mozilla to build a safer and faster browser engine (Servo).
- 2015: Rust is publicly released.
- 2015-2023: Rust gains traction in system programming and begins to make its mark in web development.
- Present: Rust is used by companies like Discord, Meta, Dropbox, and Figma. The rise of WebAssembly (Wasm) has enabled Rust to be used for both backend and frontend development, with frameworks like Yew showcasing its potential.

## Main Features of Rust and Yew

Describe the primary purpose of the tool that you have selected. Which problems does it solve? Is there something unique about this tool? How can it be useful to developers?

You may use subheadings, tables or bullet points to structure your description:
- **Example Feature:** This feature does something for a specific reason.
- **Example Feature:** This feature does something for a specific reason.
- **Example Feature:** This feature does something for a specific reason.

Example feature table:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Memory Safety | Prevents memory errors without garbage collection using the ownership model.|
| Advanced Compiler|Acts as a code auditor, providing detailed error messages for safe coding. |
| Result Type| Ensures explicit error handling, avoiding unnoticed critical errors. |
| Ownership Model| Manages memory through strict ownership rules, ensuring safety and speed. |
| High Performance | Competes with C/C++ for speed while maintaining safety. |

**Unique Concepts in Rust**
- **PhantomData:**  Allows developers to define state in a way that ensures safety and correctness. For instance, it can differentiate between unauthorized and authorized states to prevent accidental access to sensitive functions.
- **Result and Option Types:**  Require explicit handling of success and failure cases, reducing runtime errors.



| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WebAssembly Support |Yew compiles to Wasm, offering better performance and lower resource usage. |
| Reactive UI | Enables modern, reactive user interfaces similar to React but in Rust. |
| Memory Safety | Inherits Rust’s safety and ownership model, reducing runtime errors.|
| Shared Codebase | Allows shared logic between frontend and backend.|
| Tailwind CSS Support | Simplifies styling by integrating with popular tools. |

**Advantages**
- Faster and more resource-efficient than JavaScript-based frameworks.
- Strong type safety and better error handling.
- Seamless integration with Rust backend systems.

**Challenges**
- Limited documentation and ecosystem compared to mature frontend frameworks.
- Requires knowledge of both Rust and WebAssembly, making onboarding steeper.
