## Introduction

In this case study, I explore the Rust programming language and the Yew framework. Rust is celebrated for its security, high performance, and memory safety, achieved without relying on garbage collection. Its advanced compiler acts as a code auditor, ensuring correctness and safety before execution.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate Rust's type system and unique features like PhantomData, while integrating a small frontend with Yew and an API using Sanity. I chose Sanity because it is free and quick to set up, allowing me to focus on Rust’s capabilities without needing a self-hosted backend.

Had I more time, I would have built a backend with Actix, but this would have required paid server resources. Nonetheless, this setup allowed me to stress-test Rust and observe its behavior and complexity in a full-stack context.

## Brief History

You may use a bullet point list or subheadings to structure a timeline of your chosen topic's history:
- 2010: Rust is started by Mozilla to build a safer and faster browser engine (Servo).
- 2015: Rust is publicly released.
- 2015-2023: Rust gains traction in system programming and begins to make its mark in web development.
- Present: Rust is used by companies like Discord, Meta, Dropbox, and Figma. The rise of WebAssembly (Wasm) has enabled Rust to be used for both backend and frontend development, with frameworks like Yew showcasing its potential.

## Main Features of Rust and Yew

Describe the primary purpose of the tool that you have selected. Which problems does it solve? Is there something unique about this tool? How can it be useful to developers?

You may use subheadings, tables or bullet points to structure your description:
- **Example Feature:** This feature does something for a specific reason.
- **Example Feature:** This feature does something for a specific reason.
- **Example Feature:** This feature does something for a specific reason.

Example feature table:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Memory Safety | Prevents memory errors without garbage collection using the ownership model.|
| Advanced Compiler|Acts as a code auditor, providing detailed error messages for safe coding. |
| Result Type| Ensures explicit error handling, avoiding unnoticed critical errors. |
| Ownership Model| Manages memory through strict ownership rules, ensuring safety and speed. |
| High Performance | Competes with C/C++ for speed while maintaining safety. |

**Unique Concepts in Rust**
- **PhantomData:**  Allows developers to define state in a way that ensures safety and correctness. For instance, it can differentiate between unauthorized and authorized states to prevent accidental access to sensitive functions.
- **Result and Option Types:**  Require explicit handling of success and failure cases, reducing runtime errors.



| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WebAssembly Support |Yew compiles to Wasm, offering better performance and lower resource usage. |
| Reactive UI | Enables modern, reactive user interfaces similar to React but in Rust. |
| Memory Safety | Inherits Rust’s safety and ownership model, reducing runtime errors.|
| Shared Codebase | Allows shared logic between frontend and backend.|
| Tailwind CSS Support | Simplifies styling by integrating with popular tools. |

**Advantages**
- Faster and more resource-efficient than JavaScript-based frameworks.
- Strong type safety and better error handling.
- Seamless integration with Rust backend systems.

**Challenges**
- Limited documentation and ecosystem compared to mature frontend frameworks.
- Requires knowledge of both Rust and WebAssembly, making onboarding steeper.


## Market Comparison

When comparing Rust and Yew to other technologies, their unique advantages and limitations become evident. Rust offers unparalleled memory safety and performance, making it ideal for developers prioritizing reliability. However, its steep learning curve and strict ownership model may pose challenges for beginners. Yew, while fast and efficient due to WebAssembly, requires knowledge of Rust and has limited documentation, which can slow adoption. In contrast, technologies like JavaScript and React benefit from mature ecosystems but lack the inherent safety and performance of Rust and Yew.

## Getting Started

If applicable, describe how to get started with your chosen tool. By providing examples, this can help to demystify a tool and make it more accessible to beginners.

Rust

Ownership Model: Demands a deep understanding of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.

Strict Typing: Requires careful adherence to type rules, increasing development time initially.

Growing Ecosystem: While expanding, the ecosystem is not as extensive as other languages.

Yew

Steep Learning Curve: Requires knowledge of both Rust and WebAssembly.

Limited Documentation: Still early in development, making troubleshooting harder.

Wasm Challenges: Debugging and browser integration can be more complex than JavaScrit



## Conclusion

Rust

Rust is a powerful and flexible language that delivers high performance and unparalleled safety. It is ideal for developers prioritizing reliability and correctness, especially in complex systems.

Yew

Yew demonstrates that Rust can be a viable alternative for frontend development. While it is still in its early stages, it provides a promising path for full-stack development with Rust, offering better safety and performance than many current technologies.

Both Rust and Yew require significant time and effort to master, but the results are applications that are faster, safer, and more robust than most alternatives.
