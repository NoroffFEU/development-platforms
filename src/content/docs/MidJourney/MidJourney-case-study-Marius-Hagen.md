## Introduction

MidJourney is an artificial intelligence taking user prompts to generate images based on these prompts. Midjourney is created and hosted by Midjourney, Inc. Generative ai has seen a huge improvement over the past years so its use cases hase increased tremendously, and while AI can have some great use cases there also exists negatives to this kind of technology.

## Brief History

- March 14th 2022: Launched MidJourney Discord server

## Main Features
Midjourney is very easy to use and inludes lots of streamlined features to generate images and then manipulate these images. These commands and parameters help give Midjourney its own identity in the landscape of text-to-image AI

### Image Generation 
Midjourney uses Artificial intelligence to generate images in real time based on user prompts. These prompts can range from single descriptive words to whole sentences. Midjourney is closed source, however it does use a diffusion model to generate It's images similar to DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. 

Diffusion gradually adds noise then based on the prompt it will start subtracting noise until an image that can resemble the prompt based on what the ai have learnt through its training. 

The way these ai trains is they add noise onto existing images then over time it learns to recover these images by removing the noise. 

### Discord
All images are generated through commands on [Discord](https://discord.com) by writing in the official server, directly messaging the discord bot or inviting the bot to your own server. Images are generated using the **/imagine** command and the typing the prompt. Four images are returned that can then be upscaled. 

### Using your own images

- By using the /blend command you can upload 2-5 images and generate new images based on the uploaded images.
- Image prompts uses an image to influence the generation.
- Describe command generates prompt based on the uploaded image. 

### Styles and Aesthetics
There are certain ways to manipulate the generation of an image besides the prompt itself. Through discord you can use commands like --stylize and a value between 0 and 1000. 

| Command | Effect |
|---|---| 
|Stylize|Influences how stylized the generated image is|
|Style |replaces the default aesthetic of some model versions|
|Style Tuner|Generate a range of sample images with different visual styles|
|Chaos|Influences how varied the generated images are|
|Weird|Introduces weird and more experimental qualities to the generated image|

### Image size and Aspect Ratio

| Command | Effect |
|---|---| 
|Aspect Ratios|Changes the aspect ratio of image|
|Pan |increases image resolution in chosen direction|
|Upscalers|Increases size of image and can either keep details or add more details|
|Zoom out|Extends the canvas of an upscaled image without changeing the content of the original image|

### Advanced Prompts
| Command | Effect |
|---|---| 
|Permutation Prompts|Allows you to quickly generate variations of a prompt by including a list of options inside ac curly bracket seperated by commas|
|Remaster|Remasters images generated in older version of Midjourney to the latest version|
|Repeat|Runs a job multiple times|
|Seeds|A set of numbers that are generated for each image, if this seed is used when generating e new image the new image will be similar|
|Stop|Stops the image generation earlier from values 10-100|
 



## Market Comparison


### Midjourney

#### Pros
- Many commands to manipulate image generation
- High-Quality
- Easy to use

#### Cons
- Currently requires Discord
- Online only 
- Paid subscription only


### Stable Diffusion

#### Pros
- can be used offline
- open source
- Very customizable
- free version

#### Cons
- Harder to use
- Uses lots of storage

### Comparison

Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are two products that does essentialy the same, but in different ways. Midjourney wants to streamline image generation and make it as easy to use in as high quality as possible while Stable Diffusion wants to offer more options for both users and developers as they use open source code. I believe the market is different for the two products. Midjourney is more user focused, mainly private individuals while Stable Diffusion is more designed for developers and/or companies. 


## Ethics, morals and usage

The moral aspect of AI is an ongoing conversation that is very important for the landscape of art itself. Most if not all of these text-to-image models are trained on images scraped of websites like Deviantart etc. So a question comes into play whether or not this is infringment on the artists copyright. When generating an image there is a possibilty that the style of generated image will be similar to an artists style. So using AI generated images commercialy is possibly illegal. 

There is also the problem of people now using and paying for AI software to create art instead of the artists themselves. This is why i firmly believe that AI should only be used as a tool to help in creating art and never be used to automate the entire process of creating. 

One of the most prominent issues with regards to AI generated images and videos is something called deepfakes which is an AI generated image of a real person or place. This can be used to put real people into fake situations and create a fake narrative of something that have never happened. 

Fortunately multiple AI tools has terms of service restricting certain usage of these tools. Midjourney does for example not allow adult content or for the content to be used in a political context. 

The most optimal use for these AI's currently is prototyping and sketching. Using AI to generate ideas instead of finished products. 

## Getting Started

### 1. Create account or Log In to Discord
A verified Discord account is required, you can choose to use Discord through web browser, desktop app or mobile app. 

### 2. Subscribe to a plan
There are currently four subscription plans to choose from. To use midjourney you need to be subscribed to one of them.

* Basic Plan - $10/month
* Standard Plan - $30/month
* Pro Plan - $60/month
* Mega Plan - $120/month

The subscription plans vary in GPU generation time etc, you can find more details of the plans here: https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/plans

### 3. Join Discord Server
Before you can start generating images you first have to join the Midjourney Discord server using the following url: http://discord.gg/midjourney

### 4. Go to #General or #newbie
In the sidebar you can see many different channels, enter any general or newbie channel

You can also invite the Midjourney bot to your own channel or directly message the bot itself instead of writing directly in these channels. 

### 5. /imagine command
Now in the text box you can start generating images with the /imagine command then your text description of the image. example: /imagine prompt funny colorful dog 

You will also get a terms and condition prompt now if you haven't already accepted

### 6. Image selection and variations

Now a grid of four images are generated based on your prompt. You will now see 9 buttons labeld U1-U4, V1-V4 and a restart symbol. The U buttons are for upscaling the images and the V buttons are for creating variations of the images. 

### 7. Final modifcations 
After a single image is chosen, you get an expanded set of options to for example zoom in and out, pan the image or create variations of the image. 

Then you can right click and save the image or if on mobile long press the image.

## Conclusion

The AI landscape today will continue to grow, more strict rules and regulations will probably follow. Ethical usage of these tools are incredibly important. Midjourney is a very user friendly way to generate images, and they have terms and conditions to reduce malicious usage of their tool. There is still the question if they should be allowed to train their AI on copyrighted material, and there are ongoing lawsuits because of it. AI can positively influence the future of many industries, as long as it is used ethically.
