## Brief History

Microsoft and Apple started in the mid-1970s, a time full of new ideas and innovative people. Bill Gates and Paul Allen created Microsoft in 1975 and quickly made a name for themselves with Windows 1.0 in 1985, becoming big players in the computer world. Microsoft didn’t stop there; they went on to make waves in gaming with Xbox and got into social media and business services by buying LinkedIn.

On the other side, Apple began in 1976 with Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. They were all about bringing together hardware and software in ways that changed how we think about technology. The Macintosh computer in 1984 and the iPhone in 2007 are just a couple of examples of how Apple has always been at the forefront, constantly expanding with things like the iPad and Apple Watch.
