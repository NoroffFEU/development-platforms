# CircleCI

## Overview

**CircleCI** is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that automates the software development process, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure. It can integrate with GitHub, Bitbucket, and other version control systems to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## Key Features

### Automated Builds

    CircleCI automatically builds and tests your code whenever changes are pushed to the repository, ensuring code quality and consistency.
