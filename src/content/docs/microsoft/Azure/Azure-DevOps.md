## Introduction

Azure DevOps is a comprehensive suite of development tools and services provided by Microsoft as part of the Azure cloud platform. It is designed to support development teams throughout the entire process of project planning, development, testing, and deployment. This concept is crafted as an integrated solution offering multiple services to address all aspects of the software development lifecycle.

Azure DevOps seamlessly integrates with most leading tools on the market, adding an extra dimension of versatility. For instance, when working with Visual Studio Code, you can take advantage of a user-friendly command-line interface through Azure DevOps CLI. This provides access to a wide range of customizable extensions that can be adjusted to meet specific needs in the development workflow.


## Brief History

- 2005: Team Foundation Server (TFS) initially release year. And was introduced as a product independent of the cloud. It was also a part of Microsoft's collection of development tools and services called Visual Studio Team System (VSTS).

- 2012: Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) was introduced as a cloud-based version of  Team foundation server (TFS).

- 2018: Microsoft rebranded Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) to Azure DevOps. They did this to align the platform more closely with the Azure cloud ecosystem. 

- 2019: This year Azure DevOps experienced significant updates, enhancing functionality and performance. 

   - A new version was released, replacing Team Foundation Server (TFS) and allowing local installation for organizational infrastructure control.

   - Integration with GitHub Actions.

   - YAML support for builds in Azure Pipelines was strengthened.

   - Extended support for Kubernetes.

   - Deeper integration between Azure Boards and GitHub.



## Main Features
