## Introduction

Jenkins is a self-contained, open-source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

It plays a pivotal role in automating repetitive tasks, ensuring code quality, and expediting the software development lifecycle.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

It was built for continuous integration purposes. The main principle underlying CI is that developers should integrate their code changes into a shared repository as often as possible. Each task is performed in a branch, and when that branch is ready to be merged into the main branch, a pull request is created. This allows other team members to review the code changes and ensure that the code is ready to be merged into the main branch. The process of merging code into the main branch can be described as Integration as you integrate the code changes into the main branch.

Jenkins supports plugins, which allow Jenkins to be extended to meet specific needs of individual projects.

## Brief History

- 2004: The Jenkins project was started (originally called Hudson) by Kohsuke Kawaguchi, while he worked for Sun Microsystems. Kohsuke was a developer at Sun and got tired of incurring the wrath of his team every time his code broke the build. He created Jenkins as a way to perform continuous integration â€“ that is, to test his code before he did an actual commit to the repository, to be sure all was well.
- 2007: Hudson became known as a better alternative to Cruise Control and other open-source build-servers.
- 2008: At the JavaOne conference in May 2008 the software won the Duke's Choice Award in the Developer Solutions category.
- 2010: Negotiations between the principal project contributors and Oracle took place, and although there were many areas of agreement a key sticking point was the trademarked name "Hudson," after Oracle claimed the right to the name and applied for a trademark in December 2010.
- 2011: On January 11, 2011, a call for votes was made to change the project name from "Hudson" to "Jenkins."
- 2011: The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by community vote on January 29, 2011, creating the Jenkins project.
- 2011: On February 1, 2011, Oracle said that they intended to continue development of Hudson, and considered Jenkins a fork rather than a rename. Jenkins and Hudson therefore continued as two independent projects, each claiming the other was the fork.
- 2011: Creator Kohsuke Kawaguchi received an O'Reilly Open Source Award for his work on the Hudson/Jenkins project.
- 2016: On April 20, 2016, version 2 was released with the Pipeline plugin enabled by default.
- 2017: Jenkins replaced Hudson since February 8, 2017 in Eclipse.
- 2018: In March 2018 Jenkins X software project for Kubernetes was publicly presented, with support for different cloud providers including AWS EKS among others.
- 2019: In March 2019 the Linux Foundation, along with CloudBees, Google, and a number of other companies, launched a new open source software foundation called the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF). Jenkins contributors decided that their project should join this new foundation. Kawaguchi wrote at the time that nothing of significance would change for users.
- 2020: In January 2020 Kawaguchi announced he was moving to his new startup, Launchable. He also said that he would be officially stepping back from Jenkins, although staying on the CDF technical oversight committee. His role at CloudBees changed to advisor.
- As of 2023, Jenkins remains a leader in the CI/CD space. With its extensive plugin architecture and large user base, it is used by thousands of organizations worldwide. According to the 2022 DevOps Survey by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Jenkins was used by over 50% of respondents for automation and CI/CD, maintaining a significant presence in the market.

## Main Features

| Feature                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Continuous Integration             | Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice in which developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared code repository. Jenkins supports the CI approach. It allows developers to automate code integration. This means that whenever code changes are pushed to the repository, Jenkins can automatically build and test the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Continuous Delivery and Deployment | Continuous Delivery (CD) is a practice that builds upon continuous integration and enables teams to release new software changes to customers at a faster pace. It involves automating the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes so that teams can release new features and updates to customers as soon as they are ready. Jenkins allows for the continuous delivery of software by automating simple deployment processes. With plugins supporting cloud platforms, container orchestration tools, and configuration management systems, Jenkins enables teams to deliver applications to various environments reliably and efficiently.                                          |
| Task Automation                    | Another instance in which one may use Jenkins is to automate workflows and tasks. If a developer is working on several environments, they will need to install or upgrade an item on each of them. If the installation or update requires more than 100 steps to complete, it will be error-prone to do it manually. Instead, you can write down all the steps needed to complete the activity in Jenkins. It will take less time, and you can complete the installation or update without difficulty. From running periodic jobs for code analysis and testing to orchestrating complex workflows, Jenkins can be tailored to meet diverse automation needs within the software development lifecycle. |
| Build Pipeline Visualization       | Another key feature of Jenkins is its build pipeline visualization. This feature allows DevOps teams to visually represent the process of software delivery from code integration to deployment. The pipeline visualization provides a clear and intuitive representation of the software delivery process, making it easier for teams to understand and manage the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Automated Testing                  | Automated testing is another area where Jenkins shines. With Jenkins, DevOps teams can automate the process of testing their code by running scripts and integrating with automated testing tools as part of the build process. Jenkins supports a wide range of testing frameworks and tools, allowing teams to choose the ones that best fit their needs. Moreover, Jenkins can be configured to automatically run tests whenever changes are made to the code. This ensures that any issues or defects in the code are detected early and can be addressed promptly.                                                                                                                                 |

## Market Comparison
