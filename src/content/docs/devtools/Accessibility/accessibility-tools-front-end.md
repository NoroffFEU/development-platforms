## Introduction
Over 1 billion people worldwide live with some form of disability. By ignoring accessibility in web development, we exclude a significant portion of the population from accessing vital information, services, and opportunities. As frontend developers, our responsibility extends beyond aesthetics and functionality to ensuring that our work is inclusive and usable by everyone. Fortunately, modern tools make accessibility testing and implementation straightforward, enabling developers to integrate accessibility into their workflow without slowing down productivity.

This case study explores popular accessibility tools for frontend development, their features, and how they streamline the process of building inclusive web experiences.

## Why Accessibility Matters
Accessibility benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities.
- **Legal Compliance**: Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility, such as the ADA in the U.S. and the EAA in the EU.
- **Improved User Experience**: Accessibility features like keyboard navigation and proper color contrast enhance usability for all users.
- **SEO Benefits**: Accessible practices, such as semantic HTML and descriptive alt text, often align with SEO best practices.
- **Expanded Audience**: By prioritizing accessibility, you open your content to a broader audience, including people with disabilities and those in temporary situations like low lighting or injuries.

## Comparing Accessibility Tools
While each of these tools has unique strengths, they often work best when used together. For example:
- **axe Accessibility Linter** is excellent for catching issues during coding, but it might miss more complex scenarios that **Accessibility Insights for Web** can uncover.
- **Lighthouse** provides a high-level overview and scoring system, while tools like **Contrast Checker** focus on specific design-related aspects like color contrast.
- Automated tools can identify a majority of issues.

By combining these tools, developers can address accessibility issues comprehensively and create inclusive experiences.

## Integrating Accessibility into Your Workflow
Here’s how to make accessibility an integral part of your development process:

### 1. **Start with Semantic HTML**
Use appropriate HTML elements for structure (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`). This provides a strong foundation for accessibility.

### 2. **Use Tools Early and Often**
Run accessibility checks during development, not just at the end. Tools like axe and eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y help catch issues early.

### 3. **Incorporate Automated Testing**
Integrate tools like Lighthouse or axe-core into your CI/CD pipeline.
