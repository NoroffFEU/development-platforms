- November 2018: IntelliCode becomes generally available as an extension for Visual Studio users.

- April 2019: Microsoft announces the integration of IntelliCode into Visual Studio Code, expanding its reach to a wider audience.

- June 2019: IntelliCode gains support for additional programming languages, including Python and Java, further enhancing its versatility.

- March 2020: Microsoft releases IntelliCode for GitHub, allowing developers to receive AI-powered suggestions directly in their pull requests.

- October 2021: IntelliCode receives major updates, including improved model training capabilities and enhanced support for code reviews.

- January 2022: IntelliCode surpasses 10 million downloads on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, solidifying its position as a popular AI-powered coding tool.


## Main Features

- **Intelligent Code Completion :** Analyzes code and suggests contextually relevant completions.
- **Personalized Recommendations :** Learns from coding habits to provide tailored suggestions.
- **Multi-language Support :** Supports various programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and C#.
- **Model Training :** Allows developers to train custom models using their codebase for improved suggestions.



## Market Comparison

In comparison to other code completion tools available for Visual Studio Code, such as TabNine and Kite, IntelliCode stands out for its advanced AI algorithms and seamless integration with the editor. While other tools may offer similar functionality, IntelliCode's personalized recommendations based on coding habits give it an edge in the market.

## IntelliCode vs TabNine

## IntelliCode

- Advantage: IntelliCode stands out for its advanced AI algorithms, which analyze coding patterns from thousands of open-source projects to provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual coding habits. This personalized approach enhances productivity and reduces the time spent searching for the right code snippet.

- Disadvantage: However, IntelliCode may occasionally provide suggestions that are not entirely relevant or accurate, especially in complex or less common coding scenarios.

## TabNine

- Advantage: TabNine excels in providing fast and contextually relevant code completions based on the current coding context. Its support for multiple programming languages and fast performance enhances developer productivity, allowing for quick and efficient coding.

- Disadvantage: Unlike IntelliCode, TabNine lacks personalized recommendations based on individual coding habits and preferences. This may result in less accurate or relevant suggestions in certain coding scenarios.

While both IntelliCode and TabNine offer valuable features, developers may choose between them based on their specific requirements and preferences. IntelliCode's focus on personalized recommendations may appeal to those seeking tailored code suggestions, while TabNine's fast performance and contextual completions may suit developers working across multiple languages and projects.



## Getting Started

To start using IntelliCode in Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the IntelliCode extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

2. Open your codebase in Visual Studio Code.

3. As you type, IntelliCode will automatically provide contextually relevant code completions.

4. Optionally, you can train custom models using your codebase to further improve suggestions for your specific project.



## Conclusion

IntelliCode revolutionizes the coding experience in Visual Studio Code by leveraging AI to provide intelligent code completions and personalized recommendations. Despite occasional inaccuracies, its advantages in productivity enhancement and personalized assistance make it a valuable tool for developers.
