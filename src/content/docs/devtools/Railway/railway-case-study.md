## Market Comparison: Advantages and Disadvantages of Railway Vs Heroku
Railway.app is a newer entry to the cloud platform space, it offers several benefits and faces certain challenges when compared to established services like Heroku.

### Advantages and of Railway

- **User Experience:** Railway.app's interface is modern and user-friendly, designed for efficient navigation and project setup.

- **User Experience:** The recent removal of the free tier from Heroku's offerings makes Railway's free and competitively priced plans particularly attractive to developers and small teams operating on tight budgets.

- **Rapid Development Cycle:** Being a newer platform, Railway.app is agile and frequently updates its services, quickly adapting to the latest industry trends and user feedback.

- **Autoscaling:** Based on the load, Railway will automatically scale the application to meet the user demands. Railway bills only for computes on the platform. 

- **Apps run indefinitely:** Compared to Heroku, where your app shuts down when it does not receive any input for over 30 mins, deployments on Railway run indefinitely. You can either run your app using Procfile or deploy a Docker file.

### Disadvantages of Railway.app

- **User Experience:** Compared to Heroku, Railway.app has a shorter track record, which can be a concern for users looking for proven stability and a wide adoption base.

- **Community Support:** Heroku benefits from a larger, more established community and extensive documentation, which can offer a richer support experience than the burgeoning community around Railway.
