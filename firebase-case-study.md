## Introduction

As a front-end web developer, my knowledge in building web applications is only limited to the client side. When working with companies, this might not be a problem because they will hire other people who have knowledge of back-end development. The challenge of "for me" I guess, is when a front-developer wants to  build their own projects or work as a freelancer. In order to solve this problem, there are development platforms that can be used as a back-end. One of the commonly used Backend as a Service (BaaS) development platform is Firebase.

In this case study, I will discuss Firebase. The history of it, what are the services it offers, its strengths and also its weakness, and also the reason why I prefer it to the other BAas development platforms.
