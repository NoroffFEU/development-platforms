## Introduction

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and infrastructure created by Microsoft which targeted at Business and Developers without additional coding. It offers a wide range of services for building, deploying, and managing applications. Azure is widely used by organizations across various industries for its scalability, flexibility, and security features; making it one of the leading cloud computing platforms in the market.

## Brief History

Microsoft Azure was first announced in October 2008 as "Windows Azure," and was later renamed to Microsoft Azure in late March 2014. Windows Azure became commercially available in the early year of 2010 as more services were added. Microsoft Azure is available in 140 countries and regions, and is operated by more than 60 Azure regions worldwide.

The original name Windows Azure was chosen to reflect the fact that the platform was built on top of Windows Server. However, the name was changed to Microsoft Azure to reflect the fact that the platform is now built on top of Microsoft's own operating system, Windows Server.

### The First-Generation Services

The first-generation of Windows Azure started with a limited set of services. The major service which it was launched for enabled developers to run the ASP.NET web applications and APIs. After a year the Windows Azure was released, the announcement of the SQL Azure relational database and support for other programming languages like Java, PHP, and some micro related services made them ready to transform their services into a Giant.

Many more services were added when the Windows Azure became commercially available in 2010. One of the popular services was .NET Framework 4 which supported the Microsoft SQL Server. Other services that are worthed to mention at that time are OS Versioning, Content Delivery Network (CDN) and Microsoft Azure Service Bus that used to connect on-premises applications with cloud-based applications and Azure's own services.

### The Second-Generation Services

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) at the time was the best approach for customers to best control their cloud infrastructure. Developers started to use Open-Source Software (OSS) because it was cheaper, which increased the usage of software like Linux and OSS packages like MySQL, PHP, and Apache. This made Microsoft to rethink their strategy, and this was the time when they renamed their cloud platform to "Microsoft Azure". Microsoft Azure was also the best place to run the Linux Operating system after the re-strategies, and this meant that the full operations was transformed from platform as a service to infrastructure as a service.

### The Third-Generation Services

This was the era of big data, analytics and Internet of Things (IoT). Giants like Amazon and Google were all pushing their platforms and applications to meet the demand from the marked. As for Microsoft, they launched the Azure Data Lake Store and Azure Data Lake Analytics to provide an end-to-end Big Data and analytics platform on Azure. Microsoft will later go on to acquire Revolution Analytics to make the popular R language native to Azure data platform. Microsoft also foresaw the Internet of Things (IoT) as a worthy service to leverage on which they invested.

Microsoft Azure is among the first clouds service providers to have an end-to-end connected devices stack powered by Event Hub, IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, SQL Database and Power BI. As we all know currently that Microsoft is the only company to offer the core building blocks of IoT (PaaS) and a white-labelled, multi-tenant, ready-to-use IoT SaaS offering branded as Azure IoT Central.

### The Fourth-Generation Services

Apart from OSS and OSS packages, big data and IoT, software and the cloud began to drift towards intelligence. As one of the leading cloud service providers, Microsoft invested a lot of time and money into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Microsoft Azure was the only cloud service provider to offer a complete AI platform that includes the full spectrum of AI services, from data preparation to model training and deployment.

By partnering with the leading AI companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and Qualcomm, Microsoft Azure is able to offer the best AI services to its customers, and to make sure Azure IoT Edge is the best platform for to work with AI models.

## Features

Azure offers four different forms of cloud computing: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and serverless functions. Microsoft charges for Azure on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning subscribers receive a bill each month that only charges them for the specific resources and services they have used. With over 200 applications and services, Azure provides many features and capabilities for organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications. Some of the main features include:

- DevOps: Azure provides a range of DevOps services, including Azure DevOps, Azure Pipelines, and Azure Boards, which allow organizations to manage their software development lifecycle.

- Management: Azure provides a number of management services, including Azure Monitor, Azure Advisor, and Azure Policy, which allow organizations to monitor and manage their cloud environment more simply and efficiently.

- Capacity management: Azure provides a number of capacity management services, including Azure Site Recovery, Azure Backup, and Azure Automation, which allow organizations to solve storage issues that they have to deal with.

- Computational services: Azure provides a number of computational services, including Azure Batch and Azure Machine Learning. Both IaaS and PaaS are available for organizations to choose from. Multiple PaaS features allow developers to publish aspects of their websites and manage them easily.

- BC/DR (business continuity/disaster recovery): Azure provides a number of BC/DR services, including Azure Site Recovery, Azure Backup, and Azure Automation. These services allow organizations to recover from any disaster that may occur.

## Strengths

Microsoft Azure has several strengths, some of the most notable include:

- High availability: Azure provides a high availability infrastructure, with a 99.95% SLA for virtual machines and 99.9% SLA for SQL databases. This ensures that applications and data are always available and accessible.

- Scalability: Azure provides a highly scalable infrastructure that can quickly adapt to changing workloads and user demand. This allows organizations to scale up or down as needed, without having to worry about downtime or performance issues. This up-scale and down-scale can be done with just a few clicks of a button. With this scalable structure, businesses have the flexibility to pay only for what they use.

- Data security: Microsoft has a strong focus on security and privacy, and Azure provides a number of security features and certifications. Their standard security system follows a ADADSC approach: "detect, assess, diagnose, stabilize and close." paired with the strong cybersecurity controls, makes Azure a leader in IaaS security. Azure also provides simple, user-friendly tools for increased security, such as multi-factor authentication and application password requirements.

- Cost-effective: Azure provides a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing organizations to only pay for the resources they use, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses of all sizes. Additionally, the cloud environment allows businesses to launch both customer applications and internal applications, which can help saving infrastructure costs and also reduce the hardware and software maintenance burdens on in-house IT management.

## Comparison

Another popular cloud service provider is Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS and Azure provide a similar set of core features and cloud capabilities. However, they differ from each other in some essential aspects. Below are some of the differences between Azure and AWS:

- Documentation and simplicity of use: AWS offers greater ease of use and is good for first-time cloud platform adopters. The first is the dashboard, which is both feature-rich and user-friendly. However, adding users and access rules is more complex in AWS. Azure keeps all the user accounts and information in one place, although its documentation and recommendations system is less intuitive and search-friendly.

- Open-source development: AWS is good for open-source developers as it is compatible with Linux and offers many integrations for varied open-source applications. In contrast, Microsoft Azure is still in the process of embracing the open-source community, which contributes to the domination of AWS in the open-source cloud hosting space.

- Security Features: AWS does a brilliant job of selecting secure alternatives and default settings to provide enhanced privacy. Azure on the other hand, relies on Microsoft's Cloud Defender service for security and data privacy, which is powered by artificial intelligence and safeguards against new and existing threats.

- Pricing: Azure and AWS cater service and pricing based on requirements. However, AWS is rated on an hourly basis and Azure on a minute basis. Azure offers higher flexibility in short-term subscriptions.

- Machine learning: Both AWS and Azure have studios for machine learning (ML) model development. To work with AWS AI-tools, one needs coding and data science skills. On the contrary, Azure ML Studio is primarily focused on providing a codeless experience. Azure's interface features easy drag-and-drop pieces that let users build a comprehensive ML model with little to no programming knowledge.
