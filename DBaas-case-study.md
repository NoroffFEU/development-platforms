# Introduction

DBaas: Database-as-a-service (DBaaS) is a cloud computing service. As a hosted/managed service, users don’t have to worry about setting up hardware or installing software. Everything related to managing the database is handled by the service provider. 

>But what is a database? Database is an organized collection of data and information or interrelated data collected at one place.

Data in a database is arranged into tables with rows and columns and is index so that it can be easily updated, expanded, and deleted.
There are various types of databases, including the relational database, which is the most common type, distributed databases, cloud databases, and NoSQL databases.
Once the data is uploaded, the DBaaS database engine functions almost identically to an on-premises installation. 

>On-premises software: is installed and runs on computers on the premises of the person or organization using the software, rather than at a remote facility such as a server farm or cloud.


Customers no longer have to spend money on hardware, software, and IT resources to operate their own databases since DBaaS allows them to access databases hosted in the cloud and managed by a third-party supplier. Customers may quickly grow their databases as their needs change under this approach and only pay for the resources they really use, such as storage and processing power. Customers are spared the hassle and expense of maintaining their own databases since the provider controls the underlying infrastructure, including backups, security, and maintenance. 

DBaaS provides customers with the flexibility to choose from a variety of database types and configurations, such as SQL and NoSQL databases, and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easy to collaborate and access data from multiple devices.
In summary, DBaaS provides businesses and individuals with a cost-effective, scalable, and secure data management solution, allowing them to focus on their core business and applications, while relying on a robust infrastructure managed by a third-party provider.

# Brief history

DBaas (Database as a Service) is a type of cloud computing service that provides a scalable, flexible, and managed database infrastructure. It is a relatively new concept, but its roots can be traced back to the early days of cloud computing and virtualization.

The concept of DBaas started to gain traction in the late 2000s, as cloud computing became more popular and companies started to look for ways to take advantage of its benefits. *In 2009, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched Amazon RDS, which was one of the first DBAAS offerings on the market. This was followed by similar offerings from other major cloud providers, such as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.*

The DBaas market has expanded and changed over the last ten years, with new features and capabilities being added to the current products.
New technologies and standards, including NoSQL databases and novel methods of data storage like columnar and graph databases, have been developed in response to the rising need for cloud-based databases.

Nowadays, organizations of all sizes, from startups to major corporations, frequently employ DBaas as a solution to streamline and simplify their database architecture.
With all of its advantages, including lower costs, more agility, and higher scalability, it is expected to continue to be a crucial component of database administration in the future.
