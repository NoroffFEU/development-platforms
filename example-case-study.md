## Introduction

Summarise the product's primary purpose in one or two paragraphs.

MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS).
A relational database can store data in tables consisting of rows and columns
that can be related to each other using id's and something called foreign keys.
The SQL in MySQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a standardised language used by
developers to either create, select, update or delete data, among other commands.

Think of a relational database (RDB) as a digital file cabinet for storing files.
It's very important that the data stored in a database can be relied upon, to be secure and persist.
RDBs have stood the test of time and are still today the most used types of databases,
and MySQL is currently the most commonly used RDB.
