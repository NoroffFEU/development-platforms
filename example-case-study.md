## Introduction

Summarise the product's primary purpose in one or two paragraphs.

MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS).
A relational database can store data in tables consisting of rows and columns
that can be related to each other using id's and something called foreign keys.
The SQL in MySQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a standardised language used by
developers to either create, select, update or delete data, among other commands.

Think of a relational database (RDB) as a digital file cabinet for storing files.
It's very important that the data stored in a database can be relied upon, to be secure and persist.

<!-- relational databases like MySQL have several features that helps secure and persist data, like: -->

RDBs have stood the test of time and are still today the most used types of databases,
and MySQL is currently the most commonly used RDB.

## Brief History

Provide a brief history of the product, including major milestones or events.
You may use bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs or a timeline.

The first development of MySQL started in 1994 by swedish developers Allan Larson, David Axamark
and finnish developer Michael "Monty" Widenius. MySQL derived from it's proprietary predecessor mSQL,
another database management system based the low-lever language ISAM.
The developers considered mSQL to be slow and inflexible and created a new SQL interface that used
the same API as mSQL.
Keeping the same API allowed many developers to switch to the open sourced MySQL instead.
and was initially intended for personal usage.
