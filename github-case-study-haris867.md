# GitHub

## Introduction

GitHub is a hosting service which allows developers to save and store their code centrally in one location, using the version control system Git. With Git, each developer can have a copy of the code repository on their own computer and make changes to it, before pushing the changes to the central repository, on GitHub, which is the most popular place to store code repositories. It could be described as ubiquitous, as it's very widely used and known in the industry. No wonder it reportedly reached 100 million developers in January 2023, with almost 400 million repositories.

## Brief History

- GitHub was launched in 2008 and was founded by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon.

- By 2010 GitHub had reached 1 million repositories, which has now almost quadrupled.

- For its first four years, GitHub was self-funded, but in 2012 they received an investment of 100 million USD by Andeessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm.

- Microsoft started using GitHub in 2012 to host tools, like Visual Studio Code, and aqcuired GitHub in 2018, six years later, for a sum of 7.5 billion USD.

## Features

- **Collaboration**: GitHub is widely known and used, which makes it easy to use when collaborating in software development teams.

- **Management**: As GitHub is primarily for developers working together, it has been optimized to fit the needs of teams working on projects together, offering systems for reviewing code, bug tracking and planning, among many other features which makes it great for managing development teams.

- **Version control**: Git and GitHub go hand in hand and therefore developers can easily track changes made to code repositories, and go back to previous versions of a software easily, if need be.

- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub allows developers to integrate reusable blocks of code to automate tasks, such as deploying the page upon changes to the main branch in a repository and testing code before allowing merge/pull requests.

- **GitHub Pages**: GitHub Pages lets developers host static websites online, even in their free plan as long as the repository is public.

- **GitHub Marketplace**: GitHub Marketplace allows you to find an install both free and paid tools and apps to make your workflow easier.

## Strengths

### Ubiquitous

With GitHub being the most popular place to store and save code repositories, it can be called ubiquitous, meaning its widely knows and used by developers all over the world. Most developers and programmers already use or at least know GitHub, which makes transitions between teams/workplaces can happen smoothly, at least when it comes to version control.

### Usability

GitHubs interface is very user-friendly, which makes it easy to understand. With it being the most popular hosting service, a lot has been invested in the UX & UI design.

### GitHub Actions

The ability to automate tasks which otherwise would be very time-consuming is a huge benefit to both individuals and teams working on projects. GitHub Actions allows for integration of blocks of code that perform tasks such as testing code, hosting the newest version of site and making sure that there are no errors before merging to the main branch.

### GitHub Marketplace

GitHub Marketplace is like GitHubs own App store where you can find different tools and apps that make your work and workflow a lot smoother and more efficient. One example is a GitHub Action that hosts your site on GitHub Pages for you directly from your repository on GitHub.

## Weaknesses

### Complexity

GitHub has undergone a lot of improvement and has seen a huge increase in additions to its service, like GitHub Marketplace and GitHub Actions to mention a few. This can make it seem indimidating to start learning, and there is indeed a steep learning curve to it. For students new to software development and version control, it can be a lot to learn in the beginning, but as you get more familiar with the service, there is an abundance of benefits to using GitHub.

### Pay to play

It is worth mentioning that even the free plan that GitHub offers is very benificial to a lot of people, but there is still some things that GitHub won't let you do, unless you're on a paid plan. One example is that you can't keep your repository private if you're to host your website on GitHub pages. There is also a limited number of private repositories allowed for users on the free plan.

## Comparison

#### GitHub vs GitLab

GitHub and GitLab are very similar in that they're both platforms for mananaging repositories with a version control system that is based on Git, but there are still some differences between the two.

- **Popularity**: GitHub is more widely used and known, which often makes it the obvious choice as the majority of teams would be familiar with it.

- **Open Source**: GitLab is open source which is allows and encourages collaboration, making it possible for continous improvement.

- **Speed**: GitLab reportedly not as fast and perceived to be a bit slower than GitHub.

- **Cooperation**: GitHub is more tailored to developers working in teams and making sure that the organization and distribution of work and tasks runs smoothly.

- **Additions and feautures**: GitHub is, as mentioned several times already, very popular. With features and tools like GitHub Actions & GitHub Marketplace, it is more likely than GitLab to be chosen in a team setting.

## Summary

All in all, GitHub is a service that has had a huge impact on the software development community. It is a tool that allows for version tracking, storing code in repositories, as well as hosting static websites. It has allowed for collaboration like never before with it being so optimized for development projects. In addition, GitHub offers a lot of tools that optimize your workflow, like GitHub Actions and the fact that it can be used to collaborate using built-in features like GitHub Project boards for allocations tasks between team members. While GitHub started out as a small start-up, it has grown significantly since it founding year 2008. Since then, it has been bought by Microsoft and last month they reportedly reached 372 million repositories. It's safe to say that GitHub is an essential tool in todays software development community.
