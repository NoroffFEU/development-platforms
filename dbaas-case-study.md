## Introduction

DBaaS or Database-as-a-service is a cloud computing service. In this case study we will dive into what DBaaS is and how it can be beneficial for a frontend developer.

## Brief History

- Cloud computing is believed to have been invented by J.C.R Licklider in the 1960s.
- 1983, CompuServe offered consumers a small amount of disk space that could be used to store any files that they chose to upload.
- The very first DBaaS providers emerged in the early 2000s.
- Was created as an alternative to on premise database systems.

## Main Features

- Managed Service: DBaaS providers will handle all aspect of database management.

- Scalibility: Easily allows you to up or downscale your database resources.

- Security: DBaaS providers implement security measures to protect your data.

- Automated Backup: Ensures that your data is protected and can be restored in case of data loss or corruption.

- Automatic Updates: DBaaS providers will handle software updates and security patches.

- Easy Deployment: Setting up a database in a DBaaS environment is straightforward and can be done with just a few clicks.

- Monitoring and Analytics: DBaaS platforms provide monitoring and analytics tools for you to track the perfomances of your database.

## Market Comparison

DBaaS (Database as a service) vs IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).

IaaS:

Iaas functions similarly to a traditional software and database managemant. You retain hands-on control over every aspect of your infrastructure. The main difference is that a cloud server is used instead of a physical one.

Drawback: You would be responsible for installing and maintaining all databases and software of the cloud server. The money you would save by not having an on-site data center could go to waste by having to keep your software stack up to date.

DBaaS:

DbaaS providers build and maintain cloud database solutions for costumers.

Drawback: Every change requested must be worked within the environment of the provider's cloud services.

## Getting Started

To get started you would need to choose a DBaaS provider.

Some of the best providers are:

- Amazon DynamoDB
- Cloud SQL
- Oracle Database
- Azure SQL Database
- Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
