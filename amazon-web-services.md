## Introduction

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of remote computing services (also called web services) that make up a cloud computing platform, offered by Amazon.com. These services operate from 12 geographical regions across the world. They offer a variety of services such as storage, networking, databases, application services, and deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. AWS allows customers to pay for what they use, on a pay-as-you-go basis, and provides a variety of tools for monitoring and managing usage. AWS is widely used by companies of all sizes, and is particularly popular among startups and enterprises.

## Brief History

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was first introduced in 2002 as a way for Amazon to provide e-commerce companies with the ability to outsource their web infrastructure. Initially, the service was known as Amazon Web Services Simple Queue Service (SQS) and provided a way for developers to build distributed applications by allowing them to easily send and receive messages between different components of their application.

In 2004, Amazon expanded the service to include Simple Notification Service (SNS), which allowed developers to send notifications to a variety of different endpoints, such as email addresses and mobile phones. This marked the beginning of AWS's move towards becoming a more general-purpose cloud computing platform.

In 2006, Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was introduced, which allowed developers to rent virtual machines on-demand. This marked a significant shift in the way developers thought about infrastructure, as it allowed them to rapidly scale their applications up and down based on demand. EC2 also introduced the concept of "elasticity," which is the ability to automatically scale resources up and down to meet the needs of an application.

In the following years, Amazon continued to expand and improve upon the AWS offerings, introducing new services such as the Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006, the Relational Database Service (RDS) in 2009, and many more. Today, AWS has grown to be one of the most popular and widely used cloud computing platforms in the world, offering over 175 different services to customers across a wide range of industries.

## History timeline

### 2006

2006 marked a significant year in the history of Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the introduction of Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This service allowed developers to rent virtual machines on-demand, providing them with the flexibility to scale their applications up and down based on demand. This marked a major shift in the way developers thought about infrastructure, as it allowed them to rapidly scale their applications up and down based on demand. EC2 also introduced the concept of "elasticity", which is the ability to automatically scale resources up and down to meet the needs of an application. This service was a game changer for developers, it not only provided them with the ability to scale their applications, but also with the ability to pay for only what they use.

In addition to EC2, Amazon also introduced the Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006, which allowed developers to store and retrieve large amounts of data in the cloud. S3 was designed to be highly scalable, reliable and fast, it provided developers with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. This allowed developers to easily store and retrieve their data without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. The introduction of S3 and EC2 laid the foundation for many of the services that AWS offers today, and helped establish AWS as a leader in the cloud computing industry.

### 2008

Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to expand its offerings and improve upon its existing services. One of the major new services that was introduced in 2008 was Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). This service allows developers to create storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances, providing them with the ability to store persistent data that can be accessed by multiple instances. This was a significant development, as it allowed developers to store data in a way that was reliable, fast and highly available, making it an ideal solution for applications that require a high degree of data durability.

Another important service that was launched in 2008 was Amazon CloudFront. This service is a content delivery network (CDN) that allows developers to distribute their content to users globally, with low latency and high data transfer speeds. CloudFront uses a network of edge locations around the world to cache and deliver content, which allows developers to reduce the load on their own servers and improve the performance of their applications for users. This service was a major development for developers, as it allowed them to deliver their content to users in a fast and efficient way, regardless of their location.

These new services added to the AWS ecosystem of services, making AWS a more complete solution for developers and organizations to build, deploy and scale their applications, and making AWS a more viable choice for a wide range of use cases.

### 2009

Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to expand its offerings and improve upon its existing services. One of the major new services that was introduced in 2009 was the Relational Database Service (RDS). This service allows developers to easily create and manage relational databases in the cloud, such as MySQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. RDS provided developers with the ability to scale their databases up and down based on demand, and also handle common database administration tasks such as backup and patching. This service was a major development for developers, as it allowed them to easily manage their databases in the cloud, and also remove the need for them to manage the underlying infrastructure.

Another important service that was launched in 2009 was the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). This service allows developers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. ELB automatically routes incoming requests to the healthy instances and ensures that the application is always available. This service was a major development for developers, as it allowed them to easily handle traffic spikes and also improve the performance of their applications.

These new services added to the AWS ecosystem of services, making AWS a more complete solution for developers and organizations to build, deploy and scale their applications, and making AWS a more viable choice for a wide range of use cases.

### 2011

Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to expand its offerings and improve upon its existing services. One of the major new services that was introduced in 2011 was the Elastic MapReduce (EMR). This service allows developers to process big data using the Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark frameworks, without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. EMR service simplifies the process of running big data workloads on the cloud and allows for the easy integration with other AWS services, such as S3 and Redshift. This service was a major development for developers, as it allowed them to easily process large datasets and also get insights from it.

Another important service that was launched in 2011 was the DynamoDB. This service is a NoSQL database service that allows developers to easily create and manage high-performance and highly-scalable databases. DynamoDB is a fully-managed service, which means that AWS takes care of all the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on their applications. This service was a major development for developers, as it allowed them to easily store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

These new services added to the AWS ecosystem of services, making AWS a more complete solution for developers and organizations to build, deploy and scale their applications, and making AWS a more viable choice for a wide range of use cases, especially for big data workloads.

### 2013

Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to expand its offerings and improve upon its existing services. One of the major new services that was introduced in 2013 was the AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This service is a fully managed service that allows developers to easily deploy, run, and scale web applications and services. Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment to easily deploy, run and scale web applications and services written in multiple languages such as Java, .Net, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker. With Elastic Beanstalk, developers can focus on writing code, and not worry about provisioning, scaling and managing the underlying infrastructure.

Another important service that was launched in 2013 was the AWS CloudFormation. This service allows developers to use templates to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for their applications across all of their accounts and regions. AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for developers and IT operations to describe the desired state of their infrastructure and applications, and it keeps track of the actual state of the resources, making it easier to understand and control the changes in the infrastructure.

These new services added to the AWS ecosystem of services, making AWS a more complete solution for developers and organizations to build, deploy, and scale their applications, and making AWS a more viable choice for a wide range of use cases, especially for web and application development.
