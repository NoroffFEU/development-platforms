# Development-platforms
Case study on MYSQL

# Goal
To demonstrate the ability to research development platform product offerings, form opinions and relate this research to others via a written or video case study.

# Brief
The market for development platforms is vast, varied and constantly changing. Select a product or technology that fits into one of the categories discussed in this course. Research this product and compile either a written report or video presentation on the subject. This product may or may not be directly named in the course content.

Your report or video should aim to introduce the product and demonstrate its use. It should also include a discussion of the product’s history, applications, strengths/weaknesses, and how it compares to other products in the same category, if applicable.

Videos should be uploaded to a hosting service such as YouTube and be set to embeddable.

Further information, such as a template, can be found in the collaboration guide.

You may work in groups of up to three students. If you are working in a group, please use a GitHub project board to allocate tasks so that the marker can check the distribution of labour. Please include the names of all group members in the credits for each case study.
