## Introduction

Firebase is a strong BaaS platform initially created by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin, then getting picked up by Google and evolving into a more powerfull cloud based program that offers a range of tools to help developers build, but also manage apps for both desktop and mobile. As said above, it offers cloud based services (BaaS), that help simplify the process of data synchronization, performance monitoring but also user authentication. Therefore making it a key component for many developers.

## Brief History

- 2011: Firebase was founded by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin, giving users on the platform backend data sharing between users.
- 2012: Firebase Realtime Database launched. (The first product.)
- 2014: Firebase starts working but also becoming a part of Google, thus expanding within the Google Cloud system.
- 2016: Google reintroduces Firebase, integrating it even more into their platforms.
- 2019: Firebase Extensions get introduced, enhancing its functionality with Machine Learning.
- 2023: Firebase base keeps evolving, improving its connection to the Google Cloud services but also adding features like App check to its roster.

## Main Features

The Main Features that Firebase focuses on are primaraly Developement, User Growth and also App Quality.

| Feature           | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Realtime Database | This is a NoSQL Database, that syncs data from clients in real-time. Which works good with application that have chats integrated. |

| Firestore | This is a scalable database solution for clients, it gives real-time sync and offline use for web and mobile applications. |

| Firebase Authentication | Their authentication offers secure backend services that helps authenticate users.
implementing different methods for this as e-mail, password and even third parties like Facebook or Google. |

| Firebase Cloud Messaging | This tool enables sending messages/notifications to users across multiple systems or platforms. Including iOS, Android or the web. |

| Firebase Hosting | Their hosting program is both fast and secure for web applications, integrated with CDN support but also with automatic SSL encryption. |

| Firebase Analytics | This offer gives their users insight into realtime data over the trafick that goes into their site, not only that but also into user behavior, making it easier for developers to know what people are clicking on but also how they are reacting to their website. |

| Firebase Crashlytics | The Crashlytics tool is also a great tool for developers, it helps manage problems with faulty code/programming so that the developer quickly knows whats wrong and prioritizes fixing the issue and maintaining web/app stability. |

| Firebase Performance Monitoring | This is a tool to track how well the site is running, whats coming in and out of the site, to get more insight into lag or loading speed to check what is and what is not working optimally. |

| Firebase Remote Config | The Remote Config is setup to allow for updates to apps, but making it so that users do not need to update to a newer version. |

| Firebase ML Kit | ML Kit is a cool tool made up with Machine Learning given to developers so that they can integrate their creations with tasks like image recognition or text analysis. |

## Market Comparison

In this section i will be comparing how Firebase operates with similar tools that are on the market. I'll be looking at both the advantages and disadvantages of said both and comparing them to one another, i'll be using both proprietary and also open-source solutions.

| Firebase vs AWS Amplify |
Firebase :
Strengths: Very easy to use and setup, works with multiple platforms, offers its user a complete set of tools and is well integrated with Google services.
Weakness: Costs can become high with usage increase, also gives less room for the user for customization.
AWS Amplify:
Stengths: Very Scalable, gives users the option for alot of customization, works well within the AWS system.
Weakness: Is hard to setup and use, especially for someone who has not used AWS before.

| Firebase vs Backendless |
Firebase :
Strengths: Simplified and easy to understand how to setup user authentication.
Weakness: Because of the low customization and using most of what they have, makes it harder to move away from Firebase.
Backendless:
Stengths: You do not need to code for building apps, making it easier for someone with no experience, also has self hosting.
Weakness: Does not have as many integrations and real-time features as Firebase making it weak for indepth user information.

| Firebase vs Parse (Open Source) |
Firebase :
Strengths: Has an everything in one platform with frequent updates to keep everything secure and up to date.
Weakness: Because it offers everyhing in one platform it also gives it limitations, you can solely rely on what they have available.
Parse:
Stengths: This platform is open-source, giving users the opportunity to be completely creative and customize as much as they want.
Weakness: Because of the opportunity the customize as much as they want, makes it harder to maintain and keep up to date as Firebase.

This is my overall overview comparing some of Firebases competitors that are on the market and Parse which is Open Source.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Firebase is relativaly very easy.

You first need to signup. You do this using your Google account since it is integrated with the Google Cloud.

Second step us heading over to the firebase console, starting a new project and selecting what type of service matches what you might need or want.

Thirdly is getting Firebase SDK into your app, doing so is easy by following their step by step manual instruction.

Then you can deploy your site and you are good to go.

Lastly while running your site for a while you can use Analytics, crashlytics and performance monitoring to check what you have to do for your site to become even better!

Most review talking about Firebase praise how easy setting it up and using it is. Which it is because everything is basically handed to you, which also has its limitations of couse.

## Conclusion

I've learned alot about how Firebase operates, good and bad. Seeing that no one tool is perfect but many have something they are both really good at. I can see that Firebase makes it very easy for their users to get started and setup and has plenty of tools to check for insight for the site/app. But with all of this means that if you wanted to move, this would be hard since they make everything themselves, and you can't customize your site since everything must come from Google. Giving user less wiggle room. But Firebase seems like a perfect spot for a beginner to setup their site before they start learning more thus pushing their learning curve.
