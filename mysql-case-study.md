## Introduction

Summarise the product's primary purpose in one or two paragraphs.

I have chosen to write a case study about MySQL, because it is one of the world's most popular and widely used databases.
My goal is to weigh it's strengths and weaknesses against other technologies of the same kind to figure out
if this is a product worth using, if there are other more modern products with better solutions and
which cases you should use or not use MySQL.

<!-- Also I will have a look at other NoSQL databases to make a comparison -->

MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS).
A relational database can store data in tables consisting of rows and columns
that can be related to each other using id's and something called foreign keys.
The SQL in MySQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a standardised language used by
developers to either create, select, update or delete data, among other commands.

Think of a relational database (RDB) as a digital file cabinet for storing files.
It's very important that the data stored in a database can be relied upon, to be secure and persist.

<!-- relational databases like MySQL have several features that helps secure and persist data, like: -->

RDBs have stood the test of time and are still today the most used types of databases,
and MySQL is currently the most commonly used RDB.

## Brief History

Provide a brief history of the product, including major milestones or events.
You may use bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs or a timeline.

The first development of MySQL started in 1994 by swedish developers Allan Larson, David Axamark
and finnish developer Michael "Monty" Widenius. MySQL was initially intended for personal usage
and derived from it's proprietary predecessor mSQL, another database management system
based the low-lever language ISAM. The developers considered mSQL to be slow and inflexible
and created a new SQL interface that used the same API as mSQL.
Keeping the same API allowed many developers to switch to MySQL
after it's first release in May 23rd 1995.

In the year 2000, MySQL went open source which allowed it to be accessed and used by everyone.  
Since then it has grown in popularity and is currently ranked the world's most used open source database
with over 5 million active installations,
and ranks second most used overall, behind Oracle's proprietary enterprise database.
