## Introduction

Next.js is created by the company Vercel. Built on one of the most used JavaScript frameworks, React.js. Next uses React as a UI framework and uses tools such as Turbopack, formerly webpack, to beef up the speed of the website. Next is used on sites such as TikTok, Twitch, Hulu, HBO max, IGN, Nvidia, Bose, Sonos and Verge.

It also supports an interactive course with quizzes - you do not have login to get to these tutorials either.
It also has a strong community on Discord and an active community on Youtube with full length tutorials that dive deep and tutorials that go over the newest specifications.

## Weaknesses

Developers need to have pre-existing knowledge about React to use Next.
Not created by the React team, and is a product from a seperate company named Vercel.

## Comparison

Create-react-app. Create-React-App was released on July 22nd 2016, and is a powerful one-liner to create a React environment. It is managed by the React team at Meta and offers a strong simplicity with a focus on single page applications. While Create-react-app has 98.9k stars on GitHub Next.js is currently a bit above it with a 101k stars. Both carry the MIT license. Though at the time of writing this, at 00:00 the 16th of february 2023, create-react-app had it's last commit to main - on the 8th of September 2022. In contrast Next.js had a commit 40 minutes ago.
Next.js uses React as a UI framework and does the rest of the handling with Rust-based JavaScript tooling whereas CRA only has React and the features such as routing, SSR, optimization and so forth are not out of the box available.

## Summary

Next.js is based on the allready well established react.js and keeps the best part of the React library, and lets React do what it does best, the UI, while using Rust-based JavaScript tooling to do the rest of the handling. Used heavily across all sorts of platforms and for a norwegian developer there is currently 19 developer jobs that has Next.js as part of their requirements on Finn.no.
