## Introduction

Created by Vercel. nReactJS is one of the biggest JavaScript front-end library/frameworks as of writing and with Next.js you can extend React's core features with Rust-based JavaScript tooling so that you can create even faster fullstack appliactions. Next.js is used on sites such as TikTok, Twitch, Hulu, HBO max, IGN, Nvidia, Bose, Sonos and Verge

## Brief History


- create-react-app was released on July 22nd 2016 making the configuration process of creating react apps much more attainable
- Next.js gets unveiled officially at ReactConf, March 2017
- webpacks gets changed out with the improved turbopacks

You may use bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs or a timeline.

## Strengths

From basics such as createing a Next.js app, to navigation, metadata and css, pre-rendering, data fetching and API routes. It also supports an interactive course with quizzes.
It also has a strong commmunity on Discord and an active community on Youtube with full length series.

- code splitting comes with
- API routes

## Weaknesses

Developers need to have existing knowledge about React.
Not created by the React team and is a product from a seperate company named Vercel.

## Comparison
Create-react-app. Create-React-App was released on July 22nd 2016, and is a powerful one-liner to create a React set up. It is managed by the React team at Meta and offers a strong simplicity with a focus on single page applications. While Create-react-app has 98.9k stars on GitHub Next.js is currently a bit above it with a 101k stars. Both carry the MIT license. Though as the time of writing at 00:00 the 16th of february 2023, create-react-app had it's last commit to main on the 8th of September 2022, whereas Next.js had a commit 40 minutes ago.
Next.js also uses React as a UI framework and does the rest of the handling with Rust-based JavaScript tooling whereas CRA only has React and the features mentioned above with routing, SSR, image opptimazation and so forth are nowhere to be seen.

## Summary

Next.js is based on the allready well established react.js and keeps the best part of the library and extends what has been set. Used heavily across all sorts of platforms and has a large versatility that you as a developer will have to decide from.
