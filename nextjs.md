## Introduction

Next JS is created by Vercel. Built on one of the most used JavaScript frameworks, React.js, Next.js uses React as a UI framework and uses tools such as turbopack to beef up the speed of the website. Next.js is used on sites such as TikTok, Twitch, Hulu, HBO max, IGN, Nvidia, Bose, Sonos and Verge.

## Strengths

From basics such as createing a Next.js app, to navigation, metadata and css, pre-rendering, data fetching and API routes. It also supports an interactive course with quizzes you do not have login to get to these tutorials either.
It also has a strong commmunity on Discord and an active community on Youtube with full length series.

- Simple to set up, with only one line of code
  - npx create-next-app@latest
- Routing is set up for you, files and folders set up the url for the developer
- code splitting comes with
- API routes
- Faster than ever due to "Turbopack"

## Weaknesses

Developers need to have pre-existing knowledge about React.
Not created by the React team and is a product from a seperate company named Vercel.

## Comparison

Create-react-app. Create-React-App was released on July 22nd 2016, and is a powerful one-liner to create a React set up. It is managed by the React team at Meta and offers a strong simplicity with a focus on single page applications. While Create-react-app has 98.9k stars on GitHub Next.js is currently a bit above it with a 101k stars. Both carry the MIT license. Though as the time of writing at 00:00 the 16th of february 2023, create-react-app had it's last commit to main on the 8th of September 2022, whereas Next.js had a commit 40 minutes ago.
Next.js also uses React as a UI framework and does the rest of the handling with Rust-based JavaScript tooling whereas CRA only has React and the features mentioned above with routing, SSR, image opptimazation and so forth are nowhere to be seen.

## Summary

Next.js is based on the allready well established react.js and keeps the best part of the library and lets React do what it does best, the UI, while using Rust . Used heavily across all sorts of platforms and has a large versatility that you as a developer will have to decide from.
