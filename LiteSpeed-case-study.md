LiteSpeed has superior performance in terms of raw speed and scalability. It is an ideal hosting platform for serving WordPress, Joomla and Drupal based websites as it easily increases PHP's performance and security. This is done through its unique event driven architecture. It can serve thousands of clients simultaneously with minimum use of server rescources such as memory and CPU. The unique code of LiteSpeed Web Server increases PHP performance as well as serving static websites faster than Apache. It can also handle sudden spikes in traffic as well as helping to manage against DDOS attacks without any DDOS mitigation hardware.

### Security

LiteSpeed is compatible with Apache's mod_security feature and has a built-in anti-DDOS capability. Customizable features such as per-IP connections and bandwith throttling, blocks IPs that makes too many connections or requests, or ask for too much bandwith. This will stop attackers before they overrun the server.
