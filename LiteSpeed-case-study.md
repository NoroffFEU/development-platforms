## Introduction

LiteSpeed Web Server (LSWS) is a lightweight proprietary web server. It is Apache interchangable, that handles thousands of concurrent connections witha small memory footprint. It is high performance, esy to use, secure and it is easy to covert to from Apache, as it provides It's security features also makes it much less vulnerable to various attacks.
LiteSpeed can replace an excisting Apache server without changing any other programs or operating system details. It also gets implemented without breaking anything.

## Brief History

- 1990: Examples are invented by John Doe.
- 1991: Examples are first used in Example Project.
- 1996: Example Project is released to the public.
- 1999: John Doe steps down as CEO of Example Company.
- 2001: E.G. Group acquires Example Company for $1.23 billion.
- 2009: Anonymous leaks database of politically sensitive Examples to the public.
- 2010: E.G. Group open sources Example Project and all proprietary Examples.

## Main Features

###Performance & Scalability
LiteSpeed has superior performance in terms of raw speed and scalability. It is an ideal hosting platform for serving WordPress, Joomla and Drupal based websites as it easily increases PHP's performance and security. This is done through its unique event driven architecture. It can serve thousands of clients simultaneously with minimum use of server rescources such as memory and CPU. The unique code of LiteSpeed Web Server increases PHP performance as well as serving static websites faster than Apache. It can also handle sudden spikes in traffic as well as helping to manage against DDOS attacks without any DDOS mitigation hardware.

###Security
LiteSpeed is compatible with Apache's mod_security feature and has a built-in anti-DDOS capability. Customizable features such as per-IP connections and bandwith throttling, blocks IPs that makes too many connections or requests, or ask for too much bandwith. This will stop attackers before they overrun the server.

###Support
LiteSpeed has something called "zero downtime maintenance". This means that you can restart the server and update the software without compromizing your website's avaliability to users.

###Cost effective
LiteSpeed's licensing costs are quite low compared to any hardware upgrades required to run for instance Apache. The web servers unique features help reduce the support costs by providing an optimized, secure and stable hosting platform.

###Cons
LiteSpeed does not support Windows. This will eliminate it as a web server candidate for many companies.
OpenLiteSpeed is an open source and free version of LiteSpeed but this version of LiteSpeed is not compatible with Apache.
