## Introduction

LiteSpeed Web Server (LSWS) is a lightweight proprietary web server. It is Apache interchangable, that handles thousands of concurrent connections witha small memory footprint. It is high performance, esy to use, secure and it is easy to covert to from Apache, as it provides It's security features also makes it much less vulnerable to various attacks.
LiteSpeed can replace an excisting Apache server without changing any other programs or operating system details. It also gets implemented without breaking anything.


## Brief History

LiteSpeed Technologies was founded in 2002 by a team of engineers led by George Wang. LiteSpeed Web Server (LSWS) was released officially as a full featured web serveron july 1 2003. In 2007 LiteSpeed Web Server became LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise and was configured to be a drop-in replacement for Apache. This year the web server also integrated with cPanel, DirectAdmin and Plesk.
In 2015 LSWS started support for HTTP/2 and released LSCache with ESI in version 5.0.10. In 2017 they released QUIC support, and in 2019 they released support for HTTP/3.

## Main Features

### Performance & Scalability

LiteSpeed has superior performance in terms of raw speed and scalability. It is an ideal hosting platform for serving WordPress, Joomla and Drupal based websites as it easily increases PHP's performance and security. This is done through its unique event driven architecture. It can serve thousands of clients simultaneously with minimum use of server rescources such as memory and CPU. The unique code of LiteSpeed Web Server increases PHP performance as well as serving static websites faster than Apache. It can also handle sudden spikes in traffic as well as helping to manage against DDOS attacks without any DDOS mitigation hardware.


### Security

LiteSpeed is compatible with Apache's mod_security feature and has a built-in anti-DDOS capability. Customizable features such as per-IP connections and bandwith throttling, blocks IPs that makes too many connections or requests, or ask for too much bandwith. This will stop attackers before they overrun the server.


### Support

LiteSpeed has something called "zero downtime maintenance". This means that you can restart the server and update the software without compromizing your website's avaliability to users.


### Cost effective

LiteSpeed's licensing costs are quite low compared to any hardware upgrades required to run for instance Apache. The web servers unique features help reduce the support costs by providing an optimized, secure and stable hosting platform.

### Cons

LiteSpeed does not support Windows. This will eliminate it as a web server candidate for many companies.
OpenLiteSpeed is an open source and free version of LiteSpeed but this version of LiteSpeed is not compatible with Apache.


## Market Comparison

LiteSpeed Web Server is compatible with Apache Web Server and it's features such as mod_rewrite, mod_security and .htaccess. LiteSpeed can also load the Apache configuration files, and doing so can work as a direct replacement for Apache.
LiteSpeed is faster than Apache when serving PHP contents. Apache has to run alot of modules and it executes a new chain for each visitor. This is kept up for as long as the user is on the website regardless if there is a request for rescources or not.
LiteSpeed operates differently by serving the content in streams instead of pieces from its compressed cache files in response to the user's browser request. This means tha it doesn't have to create new requests each time for the same or different user and knows how to handle requests from multi-users/browsers.
Because of this caching LiteSpeed can be up to six times faster than Apache for stawtic content without draining the server resources.
Apache is a good web server for Wordpress, but with LiteSpeed's ability to increase the server's PHP performance by 50% LiteSpeed will be perfect to host WoordPress sites.
LiteSpeed was created to be used as an easy-to-use drop-in replacement for Apache. Though it does not support Windows, in copntrary to Apache. Therefore it is eliminated as a candidate for several companies, and so Apache is a better option still.
Another difference is the pricing. LiteSpeed is a paid software while Apache is free.
Apache has been a widely used web server for a number of years, but with the compatability of LiteSpeed on Apache servers and that it is more secure and can handle more with less, LiteSpeed is slowly gaining more popularity and is more widely used year by year.



## Getting Started with LiteSpeed Web Server

### Paid plans
In order to use LiteSpeed Web Server you need to select a plan. They have an option for a free trial of 15 days, and then a free starter plan. Otherwise they have plans for monthly or yearly or one time payments. You can see their pans here: [Plans](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-server/lsws-pricing).


LiteSpeed has set up an easy to read and concise guide on how to install and configure it in different ways. Therefore it is not needed for me to write it here. Just click the link below and it will take you to the installation guide they have. On the left of the page you have list of contents that you can easily get the starting help you need to get started with LiteSpeed from installing to configure and use.

## Conclusion

LiteSpeed Web Server is a lightweight alternative to Apache Web Server. It uses the same configuration and mods as Apache and is an easy to replace option. It will also handle alot more connections while simultaniously using less memory and CPU. LiteSpeed is also alot faster than Apache in serving PHP contents.
LSWS is also more cost effective and provides the ability to upgrade software without having the server to not be acessible for the users in the meantime.
Though it has all these qualities that is better than Apache, LiteSpeed does not support Windows and so it will not be an eligible option for all the companies that are using Windows. So LiteSpeed are a better option as a web server for those that don't use windows, but not an option for most companies as those use Windows.
I would personally choose LiteSpeed over Apache as it handles PHP in a way that use less resources than Apache and it is faster, especially for sites that uses PHP like WordPress. Also it is more secure than Apache with the built in Anti-DDoS, while in Apache you have security issues because of its permission for configuration madification to the individuals.
In order for you to use LiteSpeed you have to pay a monthly fee. They have a free option in "OpenLiteSpeed", though this doesn't support Apache and is updated more rarely than the paid regular version. So if you are not using Windows it will be better and more stable to pay the anual fee for the regular one rather than using the free option.
