## Introduction

LiteSpeed Web Server (LSWS) is a lightweight proprietary web server. It is Apache interchangeable, that handles thousands of concurrent connections with a small memory footprint. It is high-performance, easy to use, secure and it is easy to convert from Apache, as it provides Its security features also make it much less vulnerable to various attacks.
LiteSpeed can replace an existing Apache server without changing any other programs or operating system details. It also gets implemented without breaking anything.


## Brief History

LiteSpeed Technologies was founded in 2002 by a team of engineers led by George Wang. LiteSpeed Web Server (LSWS) was released officially as a full-featured web server on July 1 2003. In 2007 LiteSpeed Web Server became LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise and was configured to be a drop-in replacement for Apache. This year the web server also integrated with cPanel, DirectAdmin and Plesk.
In 2015 LSWS started support for HTTP/2 and released LSCache with ESI in version 5.0.10. In 2017 they released QUIC support, and in 2019 they released support for HTTP/3.

## Main Features

### Performance & Scalability

LiteSpeed has superior performance in terms of raw speed and scalability. It is an ideal hosting platform for serving WordPress, Joomla and Drupal-based websites as it easily increases PHP's performance and security. This is done through its unique event-driven architecture. It can serve thousands of clients simultaneously with minimum use of server resources such as memory and CPU. The unique code of LiteSpeed Web Server increases PHP performance as well as serving static websites faster than Apache. It can also handle sudden spikes in traffic as well as help manage DDOS attacks without any DDOS mitigation hardware.


### Security

LiteSpeed is compatible with Apache's mod_security feature and has a built-in anti-DDOS capability. Customizable features such as per-IP connections and bandwidth throttling, block IPs that make too many connections or requests, or ask for too much bandwidth. This will stop attackers before they overrun the server.


### Support

LiteSpeed has something called "zero downtime maintenance". This means that you can restart the server and update the software without compromising your website's availability to users.


### Cost effective

LiteSpeed's licensing costs are quite low compared to any hardware upgrades required to run for instance Apache. The web servers' unique features help reduce support costs by providing an optimized, secure and stable hosting platform.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Apache Drop-in replacement | Supports and runs Apache configuration files and mods, is easy to install and therefore can be used as a replacement for an already Apache-run server. |
| HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 Support | LiteSpeed keep implementing support for every new protocol that gets defined, to be keeping the implementation current and cutting-edge. |
| QUIC Support | QUIC.cloud serves content via HTTP/3 to visitors, but it also can communicate with a site's backend via HTTP/3 and QUIC, making for a complete HTTP/3-powered connection. |
| Zero Downtime | Restart the server and update the software without compromising the website's availability to the user. |
| Anti-DDoS Advances | blocks IPs that make too many connections or requests, or ask for too much bandwidth. This will stop attackers before they overrun the server. |
| Event-Driven Architecture | Fewer processes, less overhead, and enormous scalability. |
| Hosting Control Panels | Can host control panels such as cPanel, Plesk, InterWorx, VirtualAdmin and DirectAdmin |

### Cons

LiteSpeed does not support Windows. This will eliminate it as a web server candidate for many companies.
OpenLiteSpeed is an open-source and free version of LiteSpeed but this version of LiteSpeed is not compatible with Apache.


## Market Comparison

LiteSpeed Web Server is compatible with Apache Web Server and its features such as mod_rewrite, mod_security and .htaccess. LiteSpeed can also load the Apache configuration files, and doing so can work as a direct replacement for Apache.
LiteSpeed is faster than Apache when serving PHP content. Apache has to run a lot of modules and it executes a new chain for each visitor. This is kept up for as long as the user is on the website regardless if there is a request for resources or not.
LiteSpeed operates differently by serving the content in streams instead of pieces from its compressed cache files in response to the user's browser request. This means that it doesn't have to create new requests each time for the same or different user and knows how to handle requests from multi-users/browsers.
Because of this caching LiteSpeed can be up to six times faster than Apache for static content without draining the server resources.
Apache is a good web server for WordPress, but with LiteSpeed's ability to increase the server's PHP performance by 50%, LiteSpeed will be perfect for hosting WordPress sites.
LiteSpeed was created to be used as an easy-to-use drop-in replacement for Apache. Though it does not support Windows, in contrary to Apache. Therefore it is eliminated as a candidate for several companies, and so Apache is a better option still.
Another difference is the pricing. LiteSpeed is a paid software while Apache is free.
Apache has been a widely used web server for several years, but with the compatibility of LiteSpeed on Apache servers and that it is more secure and can handle more with less, LiteSpeed is slowly gaining more popularity and is more widely used year by year.



## Getting Started with LiteSpeed Web Server

### Paid plans
To use LiteSpeed Web Server you need to select a plan. They have an option for a free trial of 15 days, and then a free starter plan. Otherwise, they have plans for monthly, yearly or one-time payments. You can see their pans here: [Plans](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-server/lsws-pricing).


LiteSpeed has set up an easy-to-read and concise guide on how to install and configure it in different ways. Therefore it is not needed for me to write it here. Just click the link below and it will take you to the installation guide they have. On the left of the page, you have a list of contents that you can easily get the starting help you need to get started with LiteSpeed from installing to configuring and using.

## Conclusion

LiteSpeed Web Server is a lightweight alternative to Apache Web Server. It uses the same configuration and mods as Apache and is an easy-to-replace option. It will also handle a lot more connections while simultaneously using less memory and CPU. LiteSpeed is also a lot faster than Apache in serving PHP content.
LSWS is also more cost-effective and provides the ability to upgrade software without having the server not be accessible for the users in the meantime.
Though it has all these qualities that are better than Apache, LiteSpeed does not support Windows so it will not be an eligible option for all the companies that are using Windows. So LiteSpeed is a better option as a web server for those that don't use Windows, but not an option for most companies as those use Windows.
I would personally choose LiteSpeed over Apache as it handles PHP in a way that uses fewer resources than Apache and it is faster, especially for sites that use PHP like WordPress. Also, it is more secure than Apache with the built-in Anti-DDoS, while in Apache you have security issues because of its permission for configuration modifications to the individuals.
For you to use LiteSpeed you have to pay a monthly fee. They have a free option in "OpenLiteSpeed", though this doesn't support Apache and is updated more rarely than the paid regular version. So if you are not using Windows it will be better and more stable to pay the annual fee for the regular one rather than using the free option.
