# [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/)

## Introduction

As 2023 is well on its way, and the release of the OpenAi app ChatGPT has taken the world by storm, Artifical Intelligence has never been so popular. It's however interesting to note that machine learning has been around for quite some time. In fact, the first paper on the matter dates back to the early 1940s.
This case study will take a quick look at the history of machine learning, as well as how to use another OpenAi service, a service that many users of Visual Studio Code knows very well - GitHub Copilot.

## Brief History

As an AI pair programmer, GitHub Copilot offers suggestions to your code by analyzing the context in the file you are editing, while also looking at related files in your project.

Copilot is a relative new service with GitHub announcing it for technical preview in June, 2021. Only in June of 2022 did it come out of technical preview and became available for developers with a subscription. There has however been progress in the face of machine learning since the 1940s.

- 1943. Logician Walter Pitts and neuroscientist Warren McCulloch publishes a paper trying to mathematically map out thought processes and decision making in human cognition.
- 1950. Alan Turing, an English mathematician and computer scientist, proposed the Turing Test. A test that would deem a machine "intelligent" or "unintelligent". The machine would be credited "intelligent" based on if it could convince a human being that it, the machine, was in fact a human being. Not long after this, a summer research program at Dartmouth College became the official birthplace of AI.

These two significant points in time led to "intelligent" machine learning algorithms to form, and can today do things like play board games with human beings and use speech recognition.

Below is an overview of important points in machine learning history.

## GitHub Copilot Features

Copilot provides real-time code suggestions to help improve and autocomplete your code, making the coding process easier and more efficient. It uses its complex algorithms to suggest relevant and accurate code based on the context of what you are working on.
GitHub Copilot works with programs like, but are not limited to, JavaScript, Python and Ruby, and can also learn from the code already written. This way the AI will learn your coding style and base its suggestions on your preferences.

## How to use it

GitHub Copilot comes as a Visual Studio Code extension, and the suggestions the program gives will be displayed directly in your code editor, making it very easy to work with. Follow this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart) for a quickstart guide.

You will receive suggestions either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a comment describing what you want the code to do.

## Strengths

An obvious strength when working with Copilot is its ability to save development time. Using the program in a correct and smart way can help save hours in analysizing and looking up the right approach to a problem. Its accuracy is also extremely high, using machine learning algorithms to search through endless of possible solutions, and serving you the ones best suited for you and your coding style.
Because GitHub Copilot is fully integrated with Github, it makes it very easy for developers to access its features from within their repositories.

## Weaknesses

Because the automatic suggestions that Copilot offers come from billions of lines of open source code, the result may vary. It is important to note that while the service can help reduce hours of work, GitHub Copilot can not test its own code, so double checking and ensuring that the code works how you intended is highly recommended.
There is also the subject of copyright issues. Although small, there is a chance that the suggested code needs a proper liscensing, and without it you can have a serious problem on your hands. It is worth noting that Copilot does not run locally, and you would need to be online to use it.

Lastly, one of the biggest weaknesses in using Copilot is that it takes away from making you a better developer. There is no doubt that AI's like Copilot and ChatGPT can save precious billing hours, but if you start out using technologies like these, it will reduce the ability to truly understand the code that you are writing. And it will in the end do you a disservice.

## Comparison

There are some great technologies in the same category as GitHub Copilot available for use. While Copilot is a subscription based AI, you can find good alternatives that are free to use for anybody.

Consider this list of alternatives. It's worth mentioning that paid technologies normally offer more than free ones, but depending on your project you may not need those extra features.

## Summary

There has been some speculation and discussions upon whether AI's will be the death of a developer, but the fact of the matter is machine learning is here to stay and will rather support developers than take from them. The service will improve efficiency, and because it is not perfect and comes with its pitfalls, human interaction will always be needed for quality control.
GitHub Copilot is highly relevant for developers today and the best thing you can do is what you presumably have always done, learn the new technologies and use them to your advantage.
