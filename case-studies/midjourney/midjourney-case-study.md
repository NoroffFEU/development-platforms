Introduction 

Midjourney is an AI-based image generation tool. It uses a text-to-image model, meaning it reads a text prompt and generates an image based on the user's input. It does so by choosing an image from a large set of existing images, before adding appropriate styles and then optimizing the image. It is currently on its 5th version, and new versions are frequently being released. The Midjourney Discord server, which is where the service is accessed, has recently surpassed 15 million members and is rapidly growing.  

Midjourney Inc. is based in San Fransisco and was founded by David Holz. They have a full time staff of 11, as well as several advisors. As they are experiencing rapid growth, they are currently hiring and asking for advice from people with applicable knowledge.  

 

History 

At the time of writing, the history of Midjourney is very short. The beta version was released less than a year ago on July 12, 2022. I find it more useful to mention the technological progress prior to Midjourney that made ai image models possible.  

Artificial intelligence and the idea of intelligent robots was depicted in sci-fi comics and novels in the beginning of the 20th century. Towards the mid 20th century, it had been theorized, but the computers at the time were not sophisticated enough to store commands, only execute them.  

* The Logic Theorist, 1956 

Presented at Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956, the Logic Theorist is considered to be the first artificial intelligence program. It was written by Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Cliff Shaw in order to prove that artificial intelligence is possible, and to discuss a standard method in the field. Artificial Intelligence was officially founded as an academic discipline. 

* AI is flourishing, 1956-1974 

Between 1956-1974, AI experienced exponential growth. Computers became more accessible, funding was more prioritized, and the interest in AI and its capabilities was growing. With the bloom in all fields of AI, some researchers predicted AI would reach human intelligence or beyond in less than ten years. By then, AI could solve difficult math problems, have human like conversations, and robots could move objects around. The optimism was high, not realizing the serious obstacles that needed to be solved.  

* Funding collapses, 1974-1980 

Between 1974 and 1980, AI research slows down significantly. As a result of optimism in AI being unrealistically high, funding decreases in the beginning of the 1970s. Researchers had failed to produce promised results, and funders were getting impatient and skeptical. The reasons for this are many; limited computer power, not being able to create large enough databases, logical patterns being too simplistic among several other problems. Some of these problems were relying on breakthroughs in other fields in order to be solved. 

* AI on the rise again, 1980–1987 

In the 1980s, AI programs called “expert systems” were being used by companies around the world. These systems emulated the decision-making ability of a human expert. They were meant to assist human experts to make them more effective. In the same time period, the Japanese government was funding it’s Fifth Generation Computer project. This project aimed to create a platform for future development of AI programs, by making a computer with far better performance than what was commonly available. The development and funding from these two events are what primarily boosted AI research in this time period. 

* Ai collapses once again, 1987-1993 

Desktop computers from Apple and IBM became more powerful and cost less than the machines created by companies focusing on AI. This rendered AI less useful, causing a sudden crash in the market. At this time AI still had major obstacles to overcome, even in its most used form at the time (expert systems), and funds stopped once again.  

* The hidden rise of AI, 1993–2011 

By now, AI had a less than promising reputation. Advancements in the field was first and foremost a result of trying to solve very complex and often specific issues, primarily in the technology industry. The obstacles previously interrupting the progress in the field was becoming less of an issue. Raw computer power and memory had seen major progress, algorithms were becoming more advanced, and there was less pressure from funders to reach an improbable goal. The use of the term Artificial Intelligence was generally avoided, partly because it made funders skeptical and partly because it’s not very specific, and several branches started to devolve. There were several major breakthroughs in this time period, and AI started to advance more than ever before. Some of these advancements include: 

- Deep Blue chess engine winning against reigning world champion at the time, Gary Kasparov (1997) 

- A Stanford robot wins the DARPA Grand Challenge by driving 131 miles on its own through a desert trail (2005) 

- Watson, a question answering system created by IBM, wins the Jeopardy! quiz show by a large margin over the two prior champions (2011) 

During this time period, AI had major impact on new technology, but rarely got recognized. AI algorithms was used as part of larger systems such as data mining, speech recognition, medical diagnostics and many more. The use of AI has finally gained solid ground.  

AI in recent years, 2011-onwards 

AI has now proved its use value, exceeded the human brain in specific areas, and gained a role in some of the largest computer systems. Several branches have gained traction, some of which include: 

- Machine Learning. 

- Robotics. 

- Natural Language Processing. 

- Expert Systems. 

- Fuzzy Logic. 

- And many more. 

The continued development of AI is expected to have major impact on the future. It is described as a technological revolution by some, while by others it’s foreseen to have major negative implications. Today, AI is all around us, and we use AI based services as a natural part of our daily life. The continued development and use of these services poses major benefits to society, but also potential threats. Developers and researchers, as well as proper legislation being passed, is essential to minimize this risk. With that said, we all share a responsibility, as the use of and need for AI extends far beyond the developers themselves. 

Midjourney has had several main version releases in the short time since its release. I will briefly mention those below: 

* V1 - February 2022 

* V2 - April 12, 2022 

* V3 - July 25, 2022 

* V4 - November 5, 2022 

* V5 - March 15, 2023 

* V5.1 - May 3, 2023 

 

Features 

To access and use Midjourney, you have to join the Midjourney Discord channel and purchase a subscription. It used to have a free trial, but due to rapidly growing demand, they had to close this service. As well as the main command used to generate images, “/imagine”, Midjourney has several useful commands. I will briefly explain some of the currently available commands. 

- /ask - Get an answer to a question. 

- /blend - Blend two images together. 

- /describe - Writes four example prompts based on an image you upload. 

- /fast + /relax - Switch to fast or slow mode. 

- /stealth + /public - Switch to private or public mode. 

There are many more at the time of writing, and even more will probably be released soon.  

In addition to these commands, you can upscale and or create different versions of a generated image once the generation is complete. To do this, you simply press U1-U4 for an upscale, or V1-V4 for a different version of the corresponding image. You can also redo the image generation for all four images by pressing the recycle button.  

As a free member, you’re allowed to use images for personal use, and have to credit Midjourney. In order to use these images commercially, for marketing or as a cover image on a website for example, you will need a paid subscription. As Midjourney is rarely (if ever) eligible for copyright, selling generated art is not advisable. Midjourney states this in their terms of service. 

 

Strengths 

User friendly 

Midjourney is user friendly. You simply join the Discord server, purchase a subscription and you’re ready to create images. It's important to note that Discord does not suit everyone, but for those who do use it, Midjourney is incredibly easy to make use of. It is often described as one of the easiest AI image generators to use, as its default style is more artistic than its competitors. This means you don’t have to create long prompts in order to get good results, although longer prompts are generally better if you want a specific image.  

High quality/resolution 

The images generated by Midjourney is generally at a higher resolution than its competitors. This is useful if you want to view it in a larger scale or print it. It also provides a lot more detail. 

 

Weaknesses 

Nsfw content banned 

NSFW prompts are banned. This can be an obstacle for people wanting to create art displaying childbirth or nudity. The list of banned words is constantly being updated, which makes it hard to keep track of what is and isn’t allowed. It can also create obstacles when trying to create an image that isn’t ill intended, but you accidentally include a word which could be used for those purposes. However, there are also concerns about the potential for AI-generated images to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and biases, and the banned words are necessary to create a safe environment. 

No free trial 

Midjourney used to have a free trial where you could test the service with 25 image creations. They had to shut this down because they got overloaded, and users abused the free trial by creating multiple accounts.  

Less realistic output 

Due to the overall detail and clarity in images created by Midjourney, it sometimes gives a less realistic result. If you ask it to create a painting from a certain era or speciic artist for example, the motive is likely to suit the era or artist, but the paint strokes and the way it’s painted often does not. 

Lagal issues 

Similar to the use ai language models causing potential issues with plagiarism and intellectual property infringement, the use of ai image models has created its own legal obstacles which are important to assess. These problems arise from the fact that the model has analyzed such a large number of images it’s rarely possible to accurately tell who owns the original image which the generated image is created from. Another issue is you don’t own the images you generate, as it’s hard to prove it’s your own creation when it’s based on other people's work.  

Comparison 

There are several less used AI image generators. AI art generators is an industry on the rise, and it’s expected to continue growing. Out of simplicity I will only write about the two main current contenders: DALLE and Stable Diffusion. 

DALLE 

DALLE is an AI image generator developed by OpenAI. DALLE is unique in its ability to generate diverse and highly detailed images from text, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including design, art, and entertainment. One of the key advantages of DALLE over other AI image generators is its ability to generate images that are not only visually stunning but also semantically coherent with the textual input, thanks to its use of a large-scale transformer-based language model. DALLE is far better than Midjourney at generating realistic art coherent with its time period or specific artist, for example. However, DALLE is computationally intensive and requires a significant amount of resources, as it creates all it’s images instead of relying building on top of an existing one. 

Stable Diffusion 

Stable Diffusion is another AI image generator that uses diffusion models to generate high-quality images from noise. What sets Stable Diffusion apart from other AI image generators is its ability to generate diverse images with controllable properties such as color, style, and content, making it ideal for applications such as art, design, and animation. One of the main advantages of Stable Diffusion over other AI image generators is its ability to generate high-resolution images with fine details and textures, thanks to its use of a diffusion model that allows for precise control over the image generation process. However, Stable Diffusion is also computationally intensive and requires a large amount of resources. This can limit its accessibility for certain use cases. Shorter text prompts generally creates a less than ideal output in Stable Diffusion, making it less user friendly than Midjourney. With that said, it is free and easily available online. 

Summary 

Midjourney is an AI-based image generation tool that uses a text-to-image model to generate an image based on the user's input. It is accessed through discord, and is used primarily to create high resolution art. Although it has some issues to be aware of, the service is easy to use, and the benefits far outweigh the negatives. 

Since it was first theorized, Artificial Intelligence has encountered and overcome several major obstacles. Despite AI's less than promising reputation, AI algorithms were used as part of larger systems such as data mining, speech recognition, medical diagnostics, and many more. As time went on, it gained more traction, and AI algorithms started to be used in larger computer systems. Midjourney represents a continuation of these advancements in AI.
