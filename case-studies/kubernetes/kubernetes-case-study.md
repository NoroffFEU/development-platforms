## Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system under the Apache Licence 2.0 used for automating deployment, scaling and management.
Kubernetes is written in the Go language.

## Brief History

- 2014: Kubernetes is announced by Google.
- 2015: Kubernetes 1.0 is released.
- 2016: Helm package manager for Kubernetes is released.
- 2017: The most important competitors announced adding native support for Kubernetes (VMware, Mesosphere, Docker Inc, Microsoft Azure, AWS)

## Main Features

Kubernetes groups containers making up an application into logical units for easy discovery and management.

- **Scaling:** Kubernetes can scale without needing to increase the operating team.
- **Never outgrow:** Kubernetes grows flexibly to deliver applications easily and consistently.
- **Run everywhere:** Open-source gives you freedom to use however and whereever you want.

## Market Comparison

Compared to others...

## Getting Started

When you install Kubernetes, you can choose an installation type based on ease of maintenance, security, control, resources and expertise to operate and manage the cluster.
You can deploy a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine, cloud, or your own datacentre.
Kubernetes components should be run as container images wherever possible, and have Kubernetes manage those components.

kubectl is Kubernetes command line tool, allowing you to run commands against the Kubernetes clusters. It is available for a number of operating systems.
You can use kubectl to inspect, manage and deploy clusters.

If you want to run Kubernetes on your local computer, you need kind, which is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container nodes.
This tool requires that you have either Docker or Podman installed.
