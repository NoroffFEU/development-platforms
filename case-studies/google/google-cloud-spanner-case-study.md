## Introduction

Google Cloud Spanner stands at the crossroads of traditional relational database systems and the needs of the modern, scalable web. As part of Google's cloud services suite, it promises the best of both worlds – the familiarity and robustness of SQL databases, married to the scalability and distribution of NoSQL systems.

## Brief History

- **2007**: Google acknowledges the need for a new kind of database system, sparking the initiation of the Spanner project.
  
- **2012**: A paper on Spanner is published, detailing its capabilities and architecture, shedding light on its internal workings.
  
- **2017**: Google Cloud Spanner is introduced to the public as a part of Google Cloud services, offering businesses the unique capabilities of Spanner.

## Main Features

Spanner's capabilities include:

- **Unified Database**: Seamlessly combines the features of a traditional relational database with that of a NoSQL database.
  
- **Global Transactions**: True global consistency, which is quite the feat for a distributed system.
  
- **Scalability**: Scales horizontally, ensuring growth without pain points.
  
- **Integrated Security**: It's backed by Google's robust security infrastructure – everything from data to transaction is encrypted.
  
- **Fully Managed**: Being on the cloud, operational overhead is drastically reduced.

| Feature               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unified Database      | Blend of traditional SQL and NoSQL features.                                |
| Global Transactions   | Ensures data consistency across the globe.                                  |
| Scalability           | Horizontal scalability; grows with your needs.                              |
| Integrated Security   | Data is encrypted at rest and during transit.                               |
| Fully Managed         | Reduces operational overheads; part of Google Cloud.                        |

## Market Comparison

Spanner's hybrid nature sets it apart. While traditional SQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle are praised for their structure and integrity, they often hit barriers when it comes to large-scale global deployment. On the other hand, NoSQL databases, celebrated for their scalability, sometimes compromise on strong transactional guarantees. Spanner successfully bridges these gaps, presenting a solution that refuses to sacrifice either attribute.

## Getting Started

Setting up Spanner:

1. **Visit Google Cloud Console**: A hub for all things Google Cloud.
2. **Navigate to Spanner**: Locate Spanner under the 'Storage' category.
3. **Instance Creation**: Kickstart by creating an instance.
4. **Database Initiation**: Within the instance, one can create a new database.
5. **Begin Operations**: Whether it's executing SQL commands or setting up schemas, you're all set!

Google's official documentation offers detailed walkthroughs, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.

## Conclusion

For businesses eyeing the future while valuing the time-tested principles of traditional database management, Google Cloud Spanner presents an attractive proposition. Its global reach, unparalleled consistency guarantees, and adaptive scalability make it an indispensable tool for enterprises poised for growth.
