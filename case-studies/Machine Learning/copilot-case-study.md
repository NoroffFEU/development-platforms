## Getting Started

 **Microsoft 365** :
   1) Copilot application will be delivered to the users as a part of Microsoft 365 apps but available only for premium licenses in the Microsoft 365 E3 and E5.
   2) Launch the specific application you wish to use, e.g. Word, Excel, etc
   3) Look for the Copilot icon within the appilcation's mennu. The location may vary.
   4) Click to activate.

      *Note : "Users must possess either a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 license, as well as an Azure Active Directory account. These licenses provide access to a range of Microsoft 365 apps and services that seamlessly integrate with Copilot, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, Outlook, and Loop."
 
 **GitHub** :
   1) Download as an extension in VS Code or GitHub's code editor, Atom.
   2) Look for the Copilot icon in the VS Code sidebar or the Atom menu bar.
   3) Copilot should offer suggestions of code when coding.


## Conclusion

Both Microsoft 365 and Github Copilots are using OPEN AI GPT-3, a LLM to predict the text or code that the users want.

The disadvantages is that they are not free, users have to subscribe to their subscriptions. The limitation of the Copilot is that it will not remember the users old inputs if the program is being restarted. The potential risks are that it could introduce vulnerabilities or infringe on intellectual property rights.

However, the advantages are that the users can save time and work more efficiently. Also, the Copilot will get smarter and more tailored to the users each time the users put in new informatioins.
