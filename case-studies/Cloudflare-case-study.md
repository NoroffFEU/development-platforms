## Important events
  ### 2017
 A security issue with Cloudflare's edge servers was reported in 2017. Under certain uncommon conditions, these servers were found to be operating beyond the end of a buffer, causing them to return memory that contained confidential information such as HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, HTTP POST bodies, and other sensitive data. As a result, some of this data was cached by search engines.
Cloudflare quickly identified the problem and turned off three minor Cloudflare features - email obfuscation, Server-side Excludes and Automatic HTTPS rewrites - that were all using the same HTML parser chain that was causing the leakage.

Cloudflare quickly responded to the incident and patched the bug, and worked with its customers to help them mitigate the impact of the leak. the incident was significant because Cloudflare provides services to a large number of websites, and the leak potentially affected millions of users.

Cloudflare's response to the incident was widely praised, and the company took steps to improve its security processes and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

  ### 2019
In 2019, a new rule was added to Cloudflare's WAF Managed Rules which ended up exhausting CPUs worldwide, affecting every CPU core responsible for handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic on the network. The rule contained a poorly constructed regular expression that caused excessive backtracking, resulting in the depletion of CPUs used for HTTP/HTTPS serving. This caused Cloudflare's core proxying, CDN and WAF functionality to go down, causing visitors to see a 502 error page when accessing any Cloudflare domain.

Unfortunately, a protection that would have prevented excessive CPU usage by the regular expression was mistakenly removed during the refactoring of the WAF several weeks before. This refactoring was intended to reduce the WAF's CPU usage. 
Moreover, the regular expression engine that was utilized lacked complexity guarantees, and the test suite did not have any means of detecting an excessive consumption of CPU. This led to the deployment of a non-emergency rule change worldwide without a staged rollout. 

When the global traffic drop was first detected, it took too long for an alert to be triggered, and Cloudflare had difficulty accessing its systems due to the outage. The bypass procedure was not well-trained, and some SREs lost access to certain systems because their credentials had timed out for security reasons. Furthermore, customers were unable to access the Cloudflare Dashboard or API due to their reliance on the Cloudflare Edge. The outage persisted for around an hour and affected a significant number of websites and online services. Nonetheless, Cloudflare's prompt response and resolution of the issue helped to minimize the impact on its customers.

To prevent this from happening again, they re-introduced the excessive CPU usage protection that accidentally got removed. They manually inspected all (over 3000) rules in the WAF Managed Rules to find and correct any other instances of possible excessive backtracking. Cloudflare introduced performance profiling for all rules to the test suite, switched to Rus Regex Engine which have run-time guarantees and changed the SOP to do staged rollouts of rules in the same manner used for other software at Cloudflare while retaining the ability to do emergency global deployment for active attacks. They also put in place an emergency ability to take the Cloudflare Dashboard and AP*I off Cloudflare's edge, and, since they were slow to update during this outage, they added ad automated update of the Cloudflare Status page.

Cloudflare takes the reliability and security of its network very seriously in its constantly working to improve its systems and processes to prevent outages and other issues from occurring in the future, as well as being completely open and honest with its customers about explaining what's happening.
