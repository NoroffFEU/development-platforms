# Summary
OpenAI has developed new AI models and has released an API for accessing them. Unlike most AI systems that are designed for specific use cases, the API provides a general-purpose "text in, text out" interface, allowing users to try it on virtually any English language task. You can request access to integrate the API into your product, develop an entirely new application, or help OpenAI explore the strengths and limitations of this technology.

This case study is specifically designed to demonstrate how to access AI models through the API and implement them in your application. Its purpose is to provide step-by-step instructions on getting started with the API, along with explanations of key concepts and details. Additionally, it includes an example of how to implement the API in a simple web application.
